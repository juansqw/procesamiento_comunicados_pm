"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monetary Policy meeting of January 2012, decided to keep its Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. At the same time, it decided to leave the Lombard Interest Rate unchanged at 9.0% per annum.","01","12",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate is based on the fact that no deviations are foreseen for the inflation projection with respect to the target and for the prospects of the main determinants of inflation. For 2012, the Monetary Board, under the new explicit inflation targeting (EMI) scheme, approved a goal of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for this indicator. In December 2011, monthly inflation was 0.1%, while the year-on-year rate reached 7.8%. In addition, the interannual core inflation rose to 5.2% at the end of the year.","01","12",2
"In the external context, both the IMF and the Consensus Forecast maintain their perspectives of moderation in the growth of the world economy. The projections suggest that the United States would continue its path of incipient recovery, while Europe could be entering recession in 2012. The solution of economic policy in the eurozone seems to confront a dilemma between fiscal austerity and economic growth, which makes it difficult to correct the process of debt crisis and fiscal sustainability of that monetary union, as discussed at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. However, it is important to note that the European Union recently approved a fiscal rule that would allow the sustainability of public accounts in the long term.","01","12",3
"On the other hand, forecasts show that emerging economies would be slowing down while international financial conditions remain restricted. In that sense, China would be growing below the average of recent years, while the growth forecasts for Latin America are corrected to the downside. The prices of raw materials remain high amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.","01","12",4
"In the domestic sphere, private credit, economic activity and inflation evolve in accordance with the projections of the recent Monetary Policy Report. Credit to the private sector continues to expand at a rate close to projected nominal GDP, indicating that domestic demand preserves its growth. At the same time, the forecasts point to a convergence of interannual inflation to the target during the first quarter of 2012, which indicates that even in the middle of an electoral cycle, price stability and the continuity of macroeconomic policies would be maintained, creating a environment of certainty that facilitates the decision making of private economic agents.","01","12",5
"The Central Bank will continue to monitor the evolution of the global and domestic economy in order to react in a timely manner to risks regarding price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","12",6
"The Monetary Board, through the second resolution of December 20, 2012, decided to modify the interest rate corridor, formed by the rates of short-term remunerated deposits (overnight) and Lombarda, with which it had operated its policy during the last years. In this sense, it established that from now on the Monetary Policy Interest Rate of the Central Bank (TPM) will be exclusively a Reference Rate of the 1-Day Liquidity Operations performed by the institution, instead of the rate of paid deposits of the Central Bank. short term, which had fulfilled that role since 2005.In the external context, economic activity in the United States of America recorded a slight contraction of 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012, closing the year at 2.2%. For 2013, an expansion of 2.0% is expected according to the Economic Consensus (Consensus Forecast). The fiscal risks of the United States have moderated temporarily, while in the Euro Zone recessive conditions persist, estimating a fall of 0.4% by the end of 2012. Additionally, there is a loss of dynamism in important countries in the area, particularly Germany and France. On the other hand, the Economic Consensus predicts that Latin America's growth would be 2.7% in 2012. In most of the countries of the region, monetary policy maintains a neutral stance. International financial conditions have improved relatively and prices of primary goods remain above their historical levels. In the domestic sphere, production and domestic demand behave as predicted in the most recent Monetary Policy Report. Economic activity grew in 2012 at around 4.0%, higher than the average for Latin America. This growth indicates a moderate recovery in the second half of the year, but staying below its long-term trend. During this year, production will remain below its potential, recovering its path from next year, supported by an improvement in private consumption and investment, as total credit is recovered and economic activity is boosted.Regarding the possible impact on domestic prices, stemming from the implementation of the fiscal reform, the Central Bank estimates that its effect would have a transitory and one-off nature, so that inflation would remain around the target of this year.","01","13",1
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to react timely to risks on price stability and good functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","13",2
"At its monetary policy meeting in January 2014, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to maintain the reference rate at 6.25% per annum.","01","14",1
"The decision regarding the monetary policy rate took into account the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as market expectations. The year-on-year inflation rate closed at 3.88% in December, decreasing for the fourth consecutive month. This result was slightly below the lower limit of the target range of 5.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%. Additionally, the interannual core inflation, which is associated with inflationary pressures of monetary origin, fell to 4.42%, closing below the central value of the target.","01","14",2
"In the external context, the conditions of the world economy are characterized by a process of gradual recovery, based on a better performance of the developed countries, particularly the United States of America (USA), which grew 3.2% in the last quarter of 2013 and 1.9% throughout the year, reducing the unemployment rate from 7.9% in December 2012 to 6.7% in December 2013. According to Consensus Forecast, the US economy would grow 2.8% in 2014, while the Euro Zone would expand by 1.0%, leaving behind the recessive stage of the economic cycle.","01","14",3
"The gradual reduction of the monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve (FED), reducing its monthly purchases of financial assets to inject liquidity in US $ 20,000 million, would be restricting international financial conditions and provoking capital returns to the industrialized economies. In this context, some of the larger emerging economies such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Turkey and South Africa, mostly exporters of commodities, have experienced exchange rate pressures, which has led their central banks to tighten monetary policy stance through increases in interest rates, liquidity restrictions and interventions in the foreign exchange market, to face possible effects on inflation.","01","14",4
"It is important to point out that given the greater growth of production and employment in the US, there is a consensus among the governors of the FED that there will be no increases in the reference rate of monetary policy, at least until 2015. In that sense, the The gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus and the temporary volatility it has caused in the international capital markets, would have minimal effects on the financial and exchange markets of the smaller economies, with good macroeconomic fundamentals and without active participation in the global financial markets, as it is the case of the Dominican Republic. However, the greater dynamism in the economic activity of the United States, the country's main trading partner, would have a positive impact on Dominican economic growth, through exports and the flow of remittances, which would increase the supply of foreign currency in the country. Dominican exchange market, facilitating the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate.","01","14",5
"Additionally, economic activity and domestic demand show remarkable dynamism as of the fourth quarter of 2013, growing by 7.2%, driven during this period by exports, investment and private consumption. Credit to the private sector in national currency continues to expand at a rate above the nominal product, while improving prospects for activities related to foreign trade. In this sense, it is expected that in this year the current account deficit of the balance of payments would continue to be corrected, which together with the strengthening of public finances, would contribute to improving the macroeconomic performance of the Dominican Republic and its perception of country risk.","01","14",6
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to take the necessary measures against risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","14",7
"At its monetary policy meeting in January 2015, the Central Bank decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate (MPR) unchanged at 6.25% per annum, thus continuing with the neutral position it has maintained since August 2013.","01","15",1
"The decision on the benchmark interest rate was adopted after a thorough analysis of the risk balance around inflation projections, as well as the state of the economy based on its main indicators, market expectations and the international environment relevant. Last December, the year-on-year rate of inflation closed at 1.58%, while core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, was 2.97%. The inflation target from 2015 is 4.0% <U+00B1> 1%, according to the Monetary Program under the Inflation Targets, published at the end of last year. In the policy horizon, projections suggest that inflation would converge to the medium-term goal, while the economy would continue to grow close to its potential.","01","15",2
"In the international environment, the outlook for the growth of the world economy for 2015 remains moderate due to the projected trajectory for the Euro Zone, Japan and other industrialized economies. The United States of America shows a flattering outlook regarding the rate of expansion of its production due to the good performance of investment and private consumption. However, at its first monetary policy meeting in 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank maintained its MPR in the 0% -0.25% range, indicating that it would leave it at least until the third quarter of the year. In terms of emerging economies, Consensus Forecast has adjusted the growth projections for Asia and Latin America to 4.7% and 1.1%, respectively.","01","15",3
"On the other hand, the downward trend in the prices of the main primary goods (commodities), particularly fuels and industrial metals, continues, while international financial conditions have become more restrictive for emerging economies. As a result of the application of more expansive monetary policies in the Euro Zone, Japan and other economies with problems of economic growth, the US dollar has tended to appreciate worldwide and long-term interest rates in industrialized countries have been reduced. .","01","15",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity grew 7.1% in 2014 and it is expected that in 2015 it will continue to register an expansion close to its potential. In January, credit to the private sector in local currency was 15.6% in year-on-year terms, while total credit to the private sector, including foreign currency financing, would close this month with growth above 18.0% over the year. previous. In the fiscal part, adjustments continue and it is expected that by 2015 the Central Government deficit would be 2.4% of GDP. This process of fiscal consolidation would help strengthen the sustainability of the debt, which has improved with the operation of handling liabilities recently made by the Dominican Government with the Venezuelan company PDVSA. Additionally, external accounts will continue to strengthen in the current year and a current account deficit is projected for the end of 2015 in the range of 1.9% -2.1% of GDP. The continuous strengthening of the macroeconomic foundations of the Dominican economy facilitates the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate and a greater accumulation of international reserves.","01","15",5
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to implement monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to take the necessary measures against risks to the stability of the economy. prices and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","15",6
"At its monetary policy meeting for the month of January 2016, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.00% per annum.","01","16",1
"The decision on the reference rate has been made after an examination of the international environment relevant to the Dominican economy, as well as the domestic context taking into account the balance of risks around inflation projections and market expectations. It was observed that, as of December 2015, the interannual inflation rate reached 2.34%, below the lower limit of the goal established in the Monetary Program. At the same time, core inflation, which reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, amounted to 1.82% last year. Inflation is expected to converge gradually towards the center of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% in the policy horizon.","01","16",2
"Externally, the most recent World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced the projections for world growth from 3.6% to 3.4% for 2016, due to the problems of the main emerging economies, particularly the emerging economies. net exporters of primary goods. After the increase of its monetary policy rate (MPR) in the month of December, the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) decided to keep its MPR unchanged in January, faced with greater uncertainty in the international financial markets. The slowdown in China and the recession in several of the leading emerging economies have pushed up the country risk premiums of these economies, while the US dollar has appreciated and the price of oil and stock indicators have declined.","01","16",3
"The most recent forecasts of the Consensus Forecast (CFC) highlight that world growth would be led by the expansion of the industrialized countries. In that sense, the United States of America (USA) would register an expansion of 2.4% in 2016 and 2.5% in 2017, while the Euro Zone (ZE) would continue consolidating its recovery with growth rates of 1.7% in 2016 and 2017. Inflation is expected to approach 2.0% in both the US and the ZE, while unemployment continues to fall.","01","16",4
"The macroeconomic conditions of emerging economies remain weak. The outlook points to a slight improvement in 2016. Latin America would present a growth of 0.3% in 2016, reaching a recovery in 2017, with an expansion of 2.3%. This result would be influenced by the evolution of Venezuela and Brazil, which would remain in recession until 2016, as well as by the moderation of growth in the net exporting economies of raw materials in the region.","01","16",5
"Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential. Preliminary data show a GDP expansion rate of 7.0% in 2015. In the financial sector, private loans in local currency show a year-on-year growth of close to 12%, exceeding nominal product growth.","01","16",6
"The external accounts of the Dominican economy continue to improve in an environment of low oil prices and good performance in tourism revenues, remittances and exports from free zones. It is expected that by 2016, the current account deficit will remain around 2.0% of GDP. With regard to fiscal policy, the 2016 Budget contemplates maintaining discipline within the consolidation and sustainability efforts of public accounts. The adequate behavior of external and fiscal accounts in 2016 would facilitate the accumulation of reserves and the relative stability of the foreign exchange market.","01","16",7
"The Central Bank confirms its commitment to implement monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to take the necessary measures against possible risks to stability of prices and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","16",8
"At its monetary policy meeting for the month of January 2017, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate (MPR) at 5.50% per annum.","01","17",1
"The decision on the benchmark interest rate was adopted after a thorough analysis of the risk balance around inflation projections, as well as the state of the economy based on its main indicators, market expectations and the international environment. relevant. Last December, the year-on-year rate of inflation closed at 1.70%, while core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, was 1.89%. According to the projections, inflation would converge to the target range of 4% <U+00B1> 1% in the monetary policy horizon.","01","17",2
"In the external context, the growth prospects of the world economy are positive, with an estimated rate of expansion of 2.5% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017, according to Consensus Forecast. This improvement in world economic activity would be influenced by the United States of America (USA), which according to preliminary figures recorded a growth of 1.6% in 2016, having experienced an expansion of 1.9% year-on-year in the last quarter. For the year 2017, a better performance of this economy is expected when projecting a growth of 2.3% associated with the positive expectation of the fiscal stimulus plan that the new government of that country would implement. The greater dynamism of the US, our main trading partner, should be a positive factor for our economy in 2017.","01","17",3
"Regarding the Euro Zone (ZE), it is estimated that the real product would expand 1.6% in 2016 and in 2017 it would reach a growth of 1.4%. Inflation in these industrialized economies has maintained a positive trend, gradually approaching the targets set by its central banks. In the case of Latin America, the region would have closed in 2016 with a contraction of -0.6%, to recover in 2017 with a growth of 1.2%, according to estimates of the International Monetary Fund. On the other hand, the international prices of most primary goods show a growing trend so far this year, especially oil, industrial metals and some foods.","01","17",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity expanded at a rate of 6.6% in 2016, being the highest in the region for the third consecutive year. In the monetary sector, the dynamism in total financial system credit continues to the private sector, both in domestic and foreign currency, growing by 11.9% at the end of 2016, above the expansion of nominal GDP. Public finances during the second semester of 2016 have strengthened, as there has been an improvement in tax revenues and a moderation in public spending, with a primary surplus expected for the end of the year, which would contribute to strengthening the sustainability of the public debt.","01","17",5
"In addition, the strengthening of macroeconomic fundamentals was maintained during 2016, when the lowest current account deficit was recorded in the last decade (-1.5% of GDP), influenced by the dynamism of tourism, remittances and national exports. This good performance of the external sector allowed the Gross International Reserves to close the year at historically high levels of US $ 6,047.4 million, equivalent to a coverage of 3.9 months of imports, which gives the Dominican economy greater strength to react to any event adverse and guarantee the relative stability of the foreign exchange market.","01","17",6
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to continue conducting monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, In order to adopt the necessary measures in the face of risks regarding price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","17",7
"At its monetary policy meeting in January 2018, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% per annum.","01","18",1
"This decision was based on an exhaustive analysis of the balance of risks around inflation forecasts, the evolution of the main national macroeconomic indicators, the international environment, market expectations and medium-term projections. Inflation for the month of December 2017 was 0.97%, while year-on-year inflation stood at 4.20%, close to the central value of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program. In turn, core inflation, related to monetary conditions, reached 2.36% year-to-year at the end of 2017. Forecasts indicate that inflation would remain within the target range in the 24-month monetary policy horizon.","01","18",2
"In the international arena, the world economy experienced a growth of 3.2% in 2017, while for 2018 Consensus Forecast (CFC) estimates an expansion rate of 3.3% for the global economy. In 2017, the behavior of the world economy was driven by the performance of advanced economies, particularly by growth rates of 2.3% in the United States of America (USA) and 2.5% in the Euro Zone (ZE). By 2018, CFC projects that the dynamism of the advanced economies would continue with an expansion of 2.7% in the US and 2.2% in the ZE. On the price side, US inflation was 2.1% in 2017 and that of the EZ of 1.4%, while it is expected that by 2018 in both economies the price growth would be similar to last year.","01","18",3
"The recovery continued in Latin America (AL) during 2017, estimating a growth of 1.8% according to Consensus Forescast. By 2018, it is expected that all countries in the region would maintain a positive economic performance, with the sole exception of Venezuela. In that sense, the growth projections of CFC point to an expansion for the region of 2.6% by the end of 2018. In general terms, large economies of Latin America, exporters of commodities, would benefit from the upward trend that is observed in the international prices of primary goods, while at the same time they would be facing favorable international financial conditions in an environment of abundant liquidity worldwide.","01","18",4
"In the domestic context, the economy has reacted favorably to monetary easing measures that were implemented as of August 2017. Since that period, the active interest rate has been significantly reduced and loans to the private sector in national currency have grown in about RD $ 55 billion. The growth of credit reached 12.5% ??year-to-year at the end of January, generating a great dynamism in investment and consumption, which boosted the recovery of domestic demand. Indeed, preliminary information from the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) indicates a growth of 7.4% in the month of December and an accumulated expansion of 4.6% during the year 2017. The outlook for the Dominican economy in 2018 is positive, when projecting a growth of around 5.5% in the Monetary Program, influenced by greater expansion in the US, our main trading partner, and by the dynamism of credit at the domestic level. Macroeconomic models indicate that growth could be even higher at the end of the year, approaching 6.0%.","01","18",5
"On the other hand, the external sector continues to record a good performance, closing 2017 with a Current Account deficit of -0.2% of GDP, the lowest in thirteen years. Likewise, the positive result of the global balance of payments allowed an accumulation of international reserves of some US $ 730 million, about 4.4 months of importation. The dynamism of foreign exchange generating activities such as tourism, remittances and foreign investment contributed to this remarkable accumulation of international reserves, while at the same time facilitating the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate.","01","18",6
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability, helping to create the conditions for the economy to grow around its potential. In that sense, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures against possible risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","01","18",7
"BCRD keeps its monetary policy rate at 5.50% per year","01","19",1
"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. - At its January 2019 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.50% per annum.","01","19",2
"The decision to render the benchmark unchanged is based on a detailed analysis of the risk balance around inflation forecasts, including information from international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. December's monthly inflation was -0.22%, closing the year at 1.17%. Underlying inflation, which isolates the effects of those volatile components, closed the year at 2.47%. The forecasting system indicates that inflation would gradually converge to the target range of 4.0% to 1.0% over the 24-month policy horizon.","01","19",3
"Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published its Global Economic Outlook (WEO) report and highlighted the slowdown in global economic growth, reducing its 2019 projections from 3.7% to 3.5% and 2020 from 3.9% to 3.6%.","01","19",4
"On the other hand, Consensus Forecast predicts that the world economy would grow 2.9% during 2019 and 2.8% by 2020. Global expansion of economic activity would continue to be driven by the United States of America, although a moderation in its growth is expected, reaching 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% by 2020. Consensus Forecast also maintained its moderate growth forecast in the Euro Zone (ZE), with expansions of 1.5% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020.","01","19",5
"It can be seen from the projections of both the IMF and Consensus Forecast, which is seen as more uncertainty on the international stage, which could have an effect on policy decisions in advanced economies. In that regard, at its last meeting, the US Federal Reserve announced that the next monetary policy normalization would follow a more gradual process this year.","01","19",6
"In the case of Latin America, the region is projected to grow 1.9% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020, driven by the dynamism of economies such as the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, Paraguay, Chile and Peru. However, economic vulnerabilities and socio-political tensions continue in countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua, economies that would remain in recession in 2019.","01","19",7
"As for raw materials, after a few months of falls, the price of oil has recovered reaching about US$54 per barrel in January. Recent behavior has been influenced by a drop in both OPEC's oil inventories and production, as well as increased uncertainty in financial markets. Also, according to the International Energy Agency, the price of oil would remain around US$55 a barrel, on average, during 2019.","01","19",8
"Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential, in a context of low inflationary pressures. Indeed, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 7.0% during 2018, driven mainly by investment and private consumption. Consistent with economic dynamism, there is an increase in credit to the private sector in national currency by around 11.0% year-on-year in January 2019.","01","19",9
"Importantly, the weighted average passive interest rate on multiple banking has increased by about 100 basis points following the July 2018 Monetary Policy Rate increase. This adjustment has made it possible to close the interest rate differential against U.S. rates, helping to avoid risks in macroeconomic stability.","01","19",10
"On the fiscal policy side, public spending moderated during 2018, accounting for 5.9% growth in erogations at the end of the year, while revenue expansion reached 12.5% year-on-year, contributing to the process of consolidation of public finances. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as tourism, remittances and exports remain in remarkable dynamism, contributing to the fact that the current account deficit in the balance of payments will close the year at around -1.4% of GDP, despite a higher oil bill. The good performance of the external sector has facilitated the accumulation of international reserves in addition to contributing to the relative stability of the exchange rate.","01","19",11
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic remains attentive to the evolution of the U.S. monetary policy normalization, as well as the performance of the dollar in the international market and the price of oil globally, being prepared to react in a timely manner to any factor that may cause inflationary diversions. In this regard, the issuing body reaffirms its commitment to driving monetary policy towards the achievement of its inflation target and the smooth functioning of the financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.","01","19",12
"BCRD maintains its monetary policy rate at 4.50% per year","01","20",1
"At its January 2020 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 4.50% per annum.","01","20",2
"The benchmark decision is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. December's monthly inflation was 0.20%, while year-on-year inflation at the end of 2019 stood at 3.66%, below the focus of the target of 4.0% to 1.0%. Underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.25% in December. Going forward, both the inflation expectations of economic analysts and the BCRD forecasting system, indicate that inflation would remain around the core value of the target range by 2020.","01","20",3
"In the international environment, uncertainty factors are still persisting, associated with socio-political tensions in various regions of the world and trade disputes between major economies, which have influenced a slowdown in the global economy. More recently, volatility in international financial markets has increased as a result of the potential impact that coronavirus can have on the Chinese economy and on global growth. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that the global economy would expand by 2.9% in 2019, the lowest rate in a decade, and would recover slightly to 3.3% by 2020. On the other hand, Consensus Forecasts, which brings together leading analyst firms that make international projections, maintains the forecast of moderate global growth of 2.5% for 2019 and 2020.","01","20",4
"Economic activity in the United States of America has gradually slowed from 2.9% growth in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019, while IMF projections indicate a 2.0% expansion in 2020 for the world's main economy. In this context and with low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve maintains an accommodative monetary stance, continuing liquidity provision programmes to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) and Treasury bill purchases on the secondary market, with the aim of reducing short-term interest rates. Importantly, the Fed and market analysts do not anticipate adjustments to the benchmark interest rate this year. As for the Euro Area, economic growth has deteriorated from 1.9% in 2018 to 1.2% at the end of 2019, projecting 1.3% by 2020. ","01","20",5
" The slowdown in this bloc of countries has been influenced by the weak performance of the industrial sector in its major economies and the slowdown in international trade. Considering the absence of inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank continues to implement a package of expansionary measures, including a negative interest rate for short-term deposits of financial institutions, the liquidity provision programme for the channelling of credit to the private sector, and the purchase of sovereign bonds on the secondary market.","01","20",6
"On the other hand, in Latin America, the deterioration of economic activity has been accentuated as a result of socio-political conflicts in several of the countries of the region. Thus, the IMF estimates regional growth of just 0.1% for 2019 and a recovery of 1.6% in 2020. The region's economic slowdown during 2019 has been influenced by negative growth rates in Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Argentina, Ecuador and Paraguay, as well as the modest expansion of Brazil and the negative impact of social demonstrations in Chile, Bolivia and Colombia.","01","20",7
"In terms of raw materials, the price of Texas' intermediate oil averaged $58 during the month of January, conditioned by geopolitical conflicts in crude oil-producing countries and by the prospects for lower global demand. On the other hand, the price of gold has remained at high levels, ranking above $1,550 per troy ounce during the month of January, being used as a haven of value in an environment of high uncertainty. This behaviour of oil and gold prices favors the Dominican Republic's terms of trade and benefits the external sector of the economy.","01","20",8
"In the domestic context, the economy continues to react favourably to monetary easing measures, which have boosted domestic demand through increased consumption and private investment from the second half of 2019.

"Conditions in international stock markets continue to show a high degree of volatility, while capital flows leave emerging economies to more secure destinations. Risk premia for many net exporters of primary goods have increased, mainly due to lower prices of petroleum, industrial metals and some foods. The fall in commodity prices has generated significant depreciations in the currencies of this group of countries, causing deviations in the inflation targets and, consequently, leading several central banks to increase interest rates, contrary to the position of politics that predominates in some advanced economies. One point to note is that in the international exchange markets the appreciation of the dollar against the euro is maintained, albeit more moderately, while long-term interest rates have tended to decrease in advanced countries.","02","16",4

In the case of the US, this year's growth would close around 2.3%, improving to 2.4% by 2018. On the other hand, real production in the Euro Zone (ZE) would grow 1.6% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018. Inflation in these industrialized economies would remain positive, gradually approaching the long-term trend levels. In that sense, inflation rates of 2.5% are expected for the US and 1.6% for the ZE in 2017. By 2018, inflation would be around 2.3% in the US and 1.4% in the ZE. In the case of Latin America, after a fall of GDP of -0.5% in 2016, the region would begin the recovery of economic growth in 2017 by projecting an expansion of 1.6%, improving to 2.5% in 2018.","02","17",3
"International prices of primary goods tend towards levels higher than last year's average, especially oil, industrial metals and some foods.

"In the international arena, the outlook for the global economy continues to improve, according to the most recent forecasts of the Consensus Forecast (CFC), while inflation remains contained and labor markets are strengthened. In that sense, CFC estimates an expansion rate of 3.3% for the world economy in 2018, driven by growth of 2.8% in the United States of America (USA) and 2.3% in the Euro Zone (ZE). By 2019, the economic dynamism of the industrialized nations is expected to moderate slightly, with the US reaching a growth of 2.4% and the ZE of 1.9%.

"In the case of Latin America (AL), the recovery process would continue throughout the region with the exception of Venezuela, with an estimated growth of 2.6% for 2018 and 2.9% for 2019. International financial conditions remain favorable for emerging economies in the region. an environment of abundant liquidity worldwide. However, in the medium term, these conditions could change as the US fiscal reform and the monetary normalization of the Federal Reserve (FED) incentivize the return of capital to the United States. Precisely, in the press release published at the end of his last visit to the country, the IMF identified as a risk factor for the Dominican economy the possibility of facing more restrictive international financial conditions than expected. In addition, he pointed out as other important risk factors, the increase in international oil prices and weaker external demand than expected.","02","18",4
"In the domestic context, the economy continues to react favorably to the monetary easing measures implemented in the last two quarters of last year. In that sense, preliminary information of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) show a year-on-year growth of 7.0% in the month of January. Likewise, credit to the private sector in national currency grew around 12.0% year-on-year, while at the same time improving the outlook for private investors, as is perceived in the evolution of the indicators of industrial confidence and business climate, corresponding to the Business Opinion Survey implemented by the BCRD. Projection models indicate that in the current year, economic growth could be between 5.5% and 6.0%.","02","18",5
"On the fiscal policy side, capital spending experienced a notable recovery in the second half of 2017, which contributed to the recovery of economic activity. In the external sector, the current account closed last year with a deficit of -0.2% of GDP, which allowed historical international reserves to be accumulated, achieving a coverage of 4.4 months of imports. So far this year, international reserves have continued to rise, exceeding the record figure of US $ 8,000 million.

Inflation for the month of January 2019 was negative, registering a variation of -0.17% mainly influenced by the price behavior of the transportation and housing groups. In that sense, year-on-year inflation continued to decelerate to 0.71%, while core inflation, which excludes the prices of the most volatile goods and services, stood at 2.38%.

"In the external environment, forecasts are maintained that the world economy would grow 2.9% during 2019 and 2.8% in 2020, according to the Consensus Forecast (CFC). In the short term, the growth of global economic activity would continue to be driven by the United States of America (USA), however, there are some signs of moderation in its medium-term growth. Indeed, Consensus Forecast estimates that the US would expand 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020. In this context and before a reduction in inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has paused in the increases of its benchmark interest rate, that is, in the normalization process of its monetary policy, which is associated with greater uncertainty in the domestic and international environment facing the US.","02","19",3
"On the other hand, Consensus Forecast continues to downgrade the growth prospects of the Euro Zone (ZE), estimating an expansion of 1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. This moderation is influenced by the slowdown in some of its main economies , like Germany, Italy and France. Meanwhile, inflation projections for this group of countries are below their target, so it is expected that the European Central Bank will maintain its monetary policy stance in the medium term.","02","19",4
"In the case of Latin America, the region is projected to grow 1.9% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2020, led by the Dominican Republic, Panama, Bolivia and Paraguay.

"On the fiscal policy side, during 2018 the moderation of disbursements was maintained, measured by total spending, as growth of 5.9% was observed, while the expansion of revenues reached 12.5% ??year-on-year. By 2019, the deficit of the Central Government is expected to close at 1.7% of GDP, as contemplated by the National Budget. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic is attentive to the evolution of the normalization of the monetary policy of the United States, as well as to the behavior of international financial conditions and the global oil price, being prepared to react in a timely manner before any factor that may generate inflationary deviations.

"In the international environment, uncertainty about the negative impact coronavirus is having on the Chinese economy and its potential effect on global growth has increased, exacerbating the process of slowing down the global economy that had been affected by trade disputes and geopolitical tensions in different regions of the world. Importantly, prior to the more accelerated spread of coronavirus in recent weeks, Consensus Forecasts (CFC), which brings together leading analyst firms making international projections, had projected a moderation of global growth, from 2.5% in 2019 to 2.4% by 2020. If the spread trend of the virus continues, these projections are expected to continue to be corrected downwards due to their effects on global production, trade and tourism.","02","20",4
"In the United States of America, economic activity has gradually slowed as a result of slowing private investment and exports. Indeed, Consensus Forecasts projects that U.S. growth would moderate from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.9% by 2020. In this context and with low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve maintains an accommodative monetary stance, continuing liquidity provision programs to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) of up to USD 125 billion and purchases of Treasury bills on the secondary market for USD 60 billion per month. In the face of the spread of the coronavirus that has caused a widespread decline in the world's major stock markets, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last Friday that there are still warnings of increased risks to the U.S. economy and ready to use its tools, which would imply further reductions in the federal fund interest rate this year.","02","20",5

The slowdown in this bloc of countries has been influenced by the weak performance of the industrial sector in its major economies and the slowdown in international trade. Considering the absence of inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank continues to implement a package of expansionary measures including a negative interest rate for short-term deposits of financial institutions, the liquidity provision programme for the channelling of credit to the private sector and the purchase of sovereign debt securities on the secondary market for 20 billion euros per month.","02","20",6
"On the other hand, Latin America has accentuated the weakening of economic activity as a result of socio-political conflicts in several of the countries of the region. Thus, the IMF estimates that the region would have grown by just 0.1% in 2019 and projects a 1.6% recovery by 2020. The region's economic slowdown during 2019 has been influenced by negative growth rates in Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Argentina and Ecuador, as well as the modest expansion of Brazil and the negative impact of social demonstrations in Chile, Bolivia and Colombia.","02","20",7
"It should be noted that, given the potential impact of coronavirus, the economic prospects of the largest economies in the Latin American region could deteriorate beyond expectations, owing to their trade ties with China and its status as exporters of primary goods, mainly food and metals.","02","20",8
"Indeed, the price of most commodities has declined significantly, noting that the price of Texas' intermediate oil closed february below $45 a barrel, conditioned by the prospects for lower global demand. However, the price of gold has remained high, ranking above $1,500 per troy ounce at the close of February, as it was used as a haven of value in an environment of high uncertainty. This behaviour of oil and gold prices favors the Dominican Republic's terms of trade and benefits the external sector of the economy.","02","20",9
"In the domestic context, the economy has reacted favourably to monetary easing measures, which boosted domestic demand through increased consumption and private investment, resulting in year-on-year growth of 5.1% in 2019, the highest in Latin America. At the end of February, private credit in national currency has continued to show high dynamism, reflected in an expansion rate of more than 12% year-on-year. Favourable monetary conditions are expected to continue to support domestic demand and the economy is expected to expand around its potential by 2020.","02","20",10
"Because in recent years the Dominican Republic has strengthened its macroeconomic fundamentals, as a country it is better prepared than other emerging economies to navigate the adverse international landscape, characterized by high uncertainty due to the potential impact of coronavirus on the world economy. In this context, it is necessary to preserve economic stability, giving security and certainty to private actors in such a way as to maintain an enabling environment to sustain investment and growth, especially in a domestic environment affected by the election cycle.","02","20",11
"In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as foreign direct investment and remittances continue to perform well, compensating for recent tourism moderation and contributing to maintaining relative exchange rate stability and continuing to strengthen The International Reserves, which currently amount to almost 10% of GDP. On the other hand, in the fiscal sector, the process of consolidation of public finances is maintained, with a deficit of 2.2% of GDP projected to be achieved at the end of this year.","02","20",12
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In this sense, the institution will continue to monitor the potential impact of the coronavirus on the world economy and the other factors of uncertainty both externally and internally and its effects on aggregate demand, being prepared to continue to react in a timely manner to factors that may generate deviations from the inflation target and affect Dominican economic growth.","02","20",13
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, at its March 2012 Monetary Policy meeting, decided to maintain its Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. At the same time, it decided to leave the Lombard Interest Rate unchanged at 9.0% per annum.","03","12",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate is based on the fact that, in the month of February, the year-on-year rate of inflation fell to 6.0%, reaching within the target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2012. Likewise, the interannual core inflation it was reduced to 4.25% at the end of February, below its historical average. Given that the factors that affect the inflation forecasts have not changed significantly since the previous monetary policy meeting, the projections suggest that inflation would remain within the goal established in the Monetary Program.","03","12",2
"In the external context, the United States indicators confirm the perspective of gradual recovery of that economy, while a moderation in the Asian economies is expected, mainly China and India. In Europe, recessive conditions remain, although there is a perception that fiscal adjustments in some countries and the restructuring of Greek debt have contributed to moderate international financial risks. The greater uncertainty facing this international scenario is related to the recent volatility of oil prices.","03","12",3
"Latin America presents a favorable panorama, although not free of risks, according to the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, in its last macroeconomic report for the region, the Inter-American Development Bank considered that the region would face positive economic conditions in 2012, assuming a scenario with improvements in the US economy, a slight moderation in the Chinese economy and a short-term crisis. in Europe.","03","12",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand are evolving within the provisions of the last Monetary Policy Report. Credit to the private sector is expanding at a rate close to 11%, consistent with the expansion of nominal GDP, while market inflation expectations remain around the target of 2012. So far this year, the pressures inflation have remained low, reaching inflation 0.35% in the month of February and an accumulated 0.79% during the first two months of the year. This has contributed to the fact that inter-annual inflation maintained its downward trend and that its level has converged to the target during the first quarter of this year, consistent with that indicated in previous press releases.","03","12",5
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2012, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the global and domestic economy in order to react in a timely manner to risks related to the price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","03","12",6
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monetary Policy Meeting of March 2013, decided to keep its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (MPR) at 5.00% per annum. The decision on the reference interest rate takes into account that the forecast models predict that inflation would be within the target in the monetary policy horizon. In the same way, market expectations are close to this objective. In the month of February, the inflation rate was 0.33%. In interannual terms, general inflation stood at 4.73%, while core inflation rose to 5.15%, both within the target range for the current year.","03","13",1
"In the external context, the US economy maintains moderate growth with important signs of recovery in key markets such as real estate. The Euro Zone continues to present a recessive panorama with a delicate financial and fiscal situation. According to the Economic Consensus (Consensus Forecast), the United States of America would be growing slightly below 2.0% in the current year, while the Euro Zone would register a fall in its economic activity of around 0.3%, which would imply two consecutive years of negative growth In Latin America, although forecasts point to higher growth than in 2012, the region could be affected by a fall in commodity prices that would imply more unfavorable terms of trade for emerging economies.","03","13",2
"In the domestic sphere, production and domestic demand evolve moderately, below the potential production capacity of the economy. Credit to the private sector in national currency registered its highest growth in March 2013 in the last nine months. In year-on-year terms, private loans in local currency of all financial institutions grew above 5.0% and it is projected that by the end of the year their expansion would be in line with the nominal product. The recovery of private credit would contribute to a more rapid recovery of consumption and private investment, which would help to continue closing the output gap.","03","13",3

"At its March 2014 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 6.25% per annum.","03","14",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate takes into account the revision of the risk balance around the inflation projections and the market expectations. After decreasing in the previous six months, the year-on-year rate of inflation remained practically unchanged in February, at 2.84%, below the lower end of the target range of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1%. This result was due to a monthly variation of 0.58% in the second month of the year. Likewise, the interannual core inflation was reduced to 3.25%.","03","14",2
"In the external context, a scenario of recovery is maintained in the developed economies, especially in the United States, where the indicators of conjuncture show a better performance in private consumption, the housing market and the external sector, which allows us to foresee growth of 2.8% for the current year in an environment of low interest rates and lower unemployment. In the Euro Zone, a moderate recovery is estimated for 2014, around 1.1%, according to the Consensus Forecast. Emerging economies continue to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace. In the case of Latin America, the consensus points to a growth of 2.5% for 2014, in an environment of falling terms of trade in the region and lower liquidity in international markets. In recent months, the prices of some raw materials, particularly oil, as well as international financial conditions have remained relatively stable.

"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand maintain a healthy performance, showing a growth trend of around 5.0% in February, according to preliminary figures of the Monthly Index of Economic Activity. In the financial sector, credit to the private sector in national currency continues to expand at an interannual rate close to 13.0% in March and it is expected that by the end of the year, its growth will be around the expansion of the nominal product between 8.0 and 10.0%. The current account deficit projects to close the year at 4.2% of GDP, due to an improvement in net exports, tourism and free zones.

According to the BCRD's short-term liquidity management scheme, the rate of paid deposits (overnight) was reduced to 4.25% per annum. Likewise, the rate of expansion facilities, through purchases of securities with repurchase agreements (repos), decreased to 7.25% per annum.","03","15",1
"The decision on the reference rate was adopted taking into consideration the analysis of the perspectives of the main macroeconomic variables, especially the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as the expectations of the market and the relevant international environment. The interannual inflation rate remained below February's target of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1%, falling to 1.02%. The projections point to an inflation that would remain below the target range in the current year. Core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, was 2.76%, falling below its historical average.","03","15",2
"On the other hand, with this measure it is expected that the real interest rate will reverse the upward trend that has been exhibiting in recent months, thus improving the liquidity conditions of the financial system. This measure is consistent with the reserve accumulation process and with the change in the composition of the legal reserve coverage recently adopted.","03","15",3
"In the external sphere, the recovery process of the economic activity in the developed countries continues, driven by the effects of an expansive monetary policy. According to Consensus Forecast, the United States of America (USA) would grow 3.1% in 2015, while the Euro Zone and Japan would grow by 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively. On the other hand, Latin America on average continues showing signs of slowdown, influenced by the largest countries in the region. For 2015, the economic expansion projection for Latin America is 0.9%, similar to the growth achieved in 2014.","03","15",4
"In the international capital markets, the financial conditions for the emerging economies have been more restrictive in the last month, while the US dollar, although it has declined slightly in the last week, is trading at the highest level since the outbreak of the international crisis. The prices of basic goods have fallen during the last months, particularly those of oil. It is expected that this behavior of oil prices would continue for the rest of the year.

The relevant international environment for the Dominican economy maintains a favorable trend in the short term, given that its main trading partner, the United States of America (USA) grows, while at the same time that international markets maintain low oil prices.","03","16",2
"In the external context, the conditions of the world economy maintain a moderate growth outlook, characterized by an expansionary stance of monetary policy in some developed countries, volatility in emerging markets and a tendency for the US dollar to appreciate. Under this scenario, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 2.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2017.

"The macroeconomic fundamentals of the Dominican economy remain strong, reflected in a low current account deficit estimated at around 2.0% of GDP and a moderate estimate of the budget deficit around 2.3% of GDP for 2016. This behavior of the policy fiscal favors the sustainability of public accounts. In a context of solid macroeconomic fundamentals like the current one, it facilitates the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate, as well as the accumulation of international reserves in an amount much higher than the historical average.","03","16",6

The year-on-year inflation rate reached 2.7 % in the month of February, while the unemployment rate stood at 4.7% while continuing to observe improvements in various indicators of the labor market. In this context, the Federal Reserve (FED) increased its policy rate by 25 basis points, placing it in the 0.75% -1.00% range. It should be noted that in the opinion of the majority of the members of the FED board of governors, at least two additional increases in the policy rate could be expected for the remainder of the year.

"On the other hand, after growing 1.7% in 2016, the actual production of the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand 1.6% in 2017 and 1.5% in 2018, according to Consensus Forecast. At the same time, inflation rates are expected for the SE of 1.7% and 1.4% for those years, below the goal of 2.0% of the European Central Bank (ECB). The macroeconomic conditions in the EZ have led the ECB to maintain an expansive monetary policy stance, with a reference rate of 0.0%. As a result, the interest rate differential between the US and the ZE has increased, which has created the conditions for a strong dollar in international markets.","03","17",5
"In the case of Latin America, after a fall in GDP of -0.6% in 2016, the region would begin the recovery of economic growth according to the Consensus Forecast, projecting an expansion of the real product of 1.6% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018. This growth is consistent with the fact that countries in the region that export commodities would benefit from higher prices of primary goods in international markets. In the case of oil, the price of the barrel is around US $ 50, which indicates an increase of 13.5% in relation to its value twelve months ago.","03","17",6
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity continues to grow above its potential, although there is a gradual convergence at this level in the medium term. As of February, the trend-cycle of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) registered an interannual growth of 5.5%, in line with the projections of the Monetary Program. In turn, credit to the private sector in national currency expanded at an annual rate of around 11.0% at the end of March, a figure higher than nominal product growth.","03","17",7
"On the fiscal policy side, public finances evolve according to the budget objective of a deficit of 2.3% of GDP for 2017, which would point to a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP by the end of the year. Regarding external accounts, the current account deficit closed 2016 at 1.5% of GDP, its lowest level in a decade, allowing a significant accumulation of international reserves.

"In the international environment, the global economic outlook continues to improve, according to the most recent forecasts of the Consensus Forecast (CFC). In that sense, CFC estimates an expansion rate of 3.3% for the world economy in 2018, driven mainly by the dynamism of the industrialized economies. United States of America (USA) would grow 2.8% and the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand by 2.3% in the current year. By 2019, the economic dynamism of developed nations is expected to continue, with the US reaching a growth of 2.6% and the ZE of 1.9%. Likewise, inflationary pressures would remain moderate in advanced economies, with US inflation estimated at 2.4% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2019, and for the EZ of 1.5% in both years. In the case of Latin America (LA), the recovery prospects point to a growth of 2.6% for 2018 and 2.9% for 2019. Only Venezuela would remain in recession during the projection period.","03","18",3
"It should be noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of the US adjusted its monetary policy rate (MPR) up by 0.25 percentage points, raising it to a range between 1.50% and 1.75%, in a movement expected by the market and in response to potential inflationary pressures associated with the economic boom of that country. The market expects at least four additional increases in the US MPR in 2018 and 2019.

In that sense, preliminary information shows that in February the trend-cycle of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE), which excludes the irregular component of the series which moderates its volatility, would be growing 6.2% year-on-year. In this context in which the economy grows above its potential, private loans in national currency maintain their dynamism, registering a growth of over 13% year-on-year to March. It is important to note that the forecast models indicate that in the current year, economic growth could be around 6.0% year-on-year.","03","18",5
"On the fiscal policy side, government revenues have remained above the amount budgeted during the first quarter of the year. In this environment of higher fiscal revenues, the prospects for meeting the fiscal deficit target of 2.2% of GDP for 2018 improve.

Inflation in February 2019 was 0.37%, leading to cumulative inflation of 0.20% in the first two months of the year. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation stood at 1.19%, while underlying inflation moderated to 2.26% in February, which excludes prices for the most volatile components.

However, macroeconomic conditions show signs of gradual moderation in the US, with expansions estimated at 2.4% in 2019 and 2.0% in 2020. The Fed indicated that it would be patient in the process of monetary policy normalization, anticipating that no further increases in its benchmark interest rate would be made during the rest of the year, in a context of lower global growth, low inflationary pressures, and uncertainty in international markets about trade negotiations among the world's major economies.","03","19",4

At the same time, it decided to modify the interest rate broker of the BCRD's short-term liquidity management scheme, lowering the interest rate on the permanent ease of expansion (Repos to 1 day), from 6.00% to 4.50% per year, while the interest rate on paid deposits (Overnight) is reduced from 3.00% to 2.50% per year.","03","20",2
"A number of liquidity provision measures were also adopted, both in national and foreign currency, with the aim of making a large amount of resources available to financial institutions in such a way that credit demand from the productive sectors and Dominican households can be effectively met. Specifically, in national currency more than RD$52 billion is available to financial institutions. First, the Monetary Board authorized the flexibilization of the requirements for the coverage of the legal fit in national currency, recognizing as valid coverage the securities of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance up to RD$22,321.0 million, equivalent to 2.0 percentage points of the statutory lace ratio, to be earmarked as loans to households and productive sectors, equivalent to 2.0 percentage points of the statutory lace ratio, to be earmarked as loans to households and productive sectors , at interest rates in all cases not more than 8.0% per annum. In addition, liquidity is provided through the Repos window up to 90 days for up to RD$30 billion, with interest rates of 4.75% for Repos up to 30 days and 5.0% for Repos between 31 and 90 days, and these facilities may be renewed while the conditions that gave rise to these measures persist.","03","20",3
"On the other hand, liquidity in foreign currency of more than US$ 500 million will be provided through two mechanisms: (1) 90-day Repos operations for up to US$300 million through the electronic currency platform; and (2) the temporary easing of the legal lace coverage requirements in foreign currency of multiple banks, recognizing Ministry of Finance securities in dollars as a valid coverage of US$ 222 million, representing 2.5 percentage points of the legal lace ratio in foreign currency. These measures will help facilitate the channeling of foreign exchange to generator sectors such as tourism and exports that have been impacted by the decline in global trade and tourism flows.","03","20",4
"In addition, the Monetary Board approved a special regulatory treatment of the financial system while the overall uncertainty for the purpose of mitigating the potential impact of coronavirus on the financial system and economic operators remains. Specifically, it was authorized to: (1) freeze the qualifications and provisions of debtors at the level they were at the time of approval of this measure; (2) in the restructuring of claims, the same risk rating of the debtor shall be maintained, without generating additional provisions; (3) consider as unexpired loans disbursed against lines of credit for a period of sixty days and (4) extend for ninety days the period given to the debtor for the updating of guarantees corresponding to the appraisals. These measures will allow the timing of the payment schedule of bank debtors to be adjusted, the potential impact on the cash flow of companies moderated and the credit portfolio avoided due to the effects of COVID-19 on the performance of some productive activities.","03","20",5
"These monetary and financial measures are based on an analysis of the potential impacts of uncertainty on macroeconomic stability and take into account low inflationary pressures. In this sense, February's monthly inflation was -0.13%, while underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.50% in February. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from February 2019 to February 2020, stood at 3.66%, remaining within the target range of 4.0% to 1.0%. Moving forward, the BCRD's forecasting system indicates that inflation would maintain a downward trend in the coming months, hovering around the lower bound of the target range during 2020. The absence of inflationary pressures gives the BCRD additional degrees of freedom to react in a timely manner, if necessary.","03","20",6
"In the international environment, the accelerated spread of coronavirus has forced strong containment measures, which would have a significant impact on global economic activity. As a result, Consensus Forecasts (CFC), which brings together leading analyst firms that make international projections, slowed its global growth outlook from 2.5% in 2019 to 2.1% by 2020. If the spread trend of the virus continues, these projections are expected to continue to be revised downwards due to their effects on global production, trade and tourism. In response to these recent developments, central banks around the world have taken measures to monetary easing and provide liquidity.","03","20",7
"In the United States of America, Consensus Forecasts projects that growth would moderate from 2.3% in 2019 to 1.6% by 2020. In a context of uncertainty, significant stock market decline and low inflationary pressures, the Fed reduced the federal funds rate by 150 basis points in two emergency meetings, placing it in the range of 0% - 0.25%, while expanding liquidity provision programs to the financial system through Repos for up to 90 days and purchases on the secondary market for Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.","03","20",8
"As for the Euro Area, Consensus projects an even smaller expansion of 0.6% by 2020. In response to the potential impact of coronavirus, the European Central Bank extended the liquidity provision programme for private credit pipeline through financial institutions and expanded the purchase of sovereign debt securities on the secondary market. It also keeps the short-term deposit rate (overnight) at -0.50% per annum. On the other hand, Latin America, which was already facing a weakened economic situation, has been affected by the impact of coronavirus on commodity prices, causing a reduction in the regional growth outlook to 0.8% by 2020. In this context, several central banks such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Costa Rica have lowered their interest rates this year, as well as taking liquidity provision measures through financial institutions.","03","20",9
"High uncertainty and weakening global demand has manifested itself crucially in the prices of most commodities, highlighting the significant reduction in the price of Texas intermediate oil, with the price of Texas falling below $30 a barrel in recent days, equivalent to a year-on-year drop of about 50%. However, the price of gold remains around $1,500 per troy ounce, being used as a value shelter in an environment of high uncertainty. This price behaviour of primary goods implies an improvement in terms of exchange for the Dominican Republic, which would partially offset the potential impact of coronavirus on the external sector.","03","20",10
"Es importante destacar que este choque adverso encuentra a la economa dominicana con fuertes fundamentos macroeconmicos, reflejados en un crecimiento en torno al potencial, inflacin baja y estable, un crdito al sector privado dinmico y altos niveles de reservas internacionales, otorgndole una mayor capacidad de reaccin para enfrentar los retos derivados del mismo.

"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, at its Monetary Policy meeting in April 2012, decided to keep its Monetary Policy Rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. At the same time, it decided to leave the Lombard Interest Rate unchanged at 9.0% per annum.","04","12",1
"The decision regarding the benchmark interest rate is based on the fact that in March, the interannual rate of inflation converged to the target for 2012 of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1%, at 4.94%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation fell to 3.94%, below its historical average. Forecasts indicate that inflationary pressures are not expected to rise in the monetary policy horizon.","04","12",2
"In the external context, the most recent indicators of the United States show a moderate recovery process, while data from Europe confirm the weakness of its economic growth, while some countries such as Spain and England have entered recession. On the other hand, emerging economies continue to be the engine of growth of the world economy, although they show less dynamism than last year.","04","12",3
"The risks arising from the European crisis remain high due to the resurgence of some financial tensions in the markets of that region. Globally, markets have been experiencing greater volatility and risk aversion given the uncertainty surrounding some advanced economies. International prices of raw materials have decreased slightly in the last month, but remain at relatively high levels.","04","12",4
"In the domestic sphere, demand and economic activity continue to grow moderately. Similarly, credit to the private sector in national currency is expanding at around 10% per year, a rate close to the growth projection of nominal GDP for the current year. On the other hand, market inflation expectations, both for the end of this year and for the next 12 months, show a slight decrease, remaining close to the target. So far in 2012, inflationary pressures continue to decline, registering an increase of 0.15% in the Consumer Price Index in March, with cumulative inflation of 0.94% during the first quarter of the year. The reduction in inflationary pressures has contributed to maintaining the downward trend of the interannual inflation rate, while maintaining the relative stability of the exchange rate. The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2012, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to react in a timely manner to risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","04","12",5
"Monetary Policy under Alternative Scenarios A staff presentation provided an overview of an exercise that explored individual participants<U+0092> views on appropriate monetary policy responses under alternative economic scenarios. Committee participants discussed the potential value and drawbacks of this type of exercise for both internal deliberations and external communications about monetary policy. Possible benefits include helping to clarify the factors that individual participants judge most important in forming their views about the economic outlook and their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Two potential limitations of this approach are that the scenario descriptions must by necessity be incomplete, and the practical range of scenarios that can be examined may be insufficient to be informative, given the degree of uncertainty surrounding possible outcomes. Some participants stated that exercises using alternative scenarios, with appropriate adjustments, could potentially be helpful for internal deliberations and, thus, should be explored further. However, no decision was made at this meeting regarding future exercises along these lines. Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on March 13, 2012. He also reported on System open market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the maturity extension program authorized at the September 20<U+0096>21, 2011, FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk<U+0092>s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System<U+0092>s account over the intermeeting period. With Mr. Lacker dissenting, the Committee agreed to extend the reciprocal currency (swap) arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Banco de M<e9>xico for an additional year beginning in mid-December 2012; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada allows for cumulative drawings of up to $2 billion equivalent, and the arrangement with the Banco de M<e9>xico allows for cumulative drawings of up to $3 billion equivalent. The vote to renew the System<U+0092>s participation in these swap arrangements was taken at this meeting because a provision in the Framework Agreement requires each party to provide six months<U+0092> prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation. Mr. Lacker dissented because of his opposition, as indicated at the January meeting, to foreign exchange market intervention by the Federal Reserve, which such swap arrangements might facilitate, and because of his opposition to direct lending to foreign central banks. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the April 24<U+0096>25 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding moderately. Payroll employment continued to move up, and the unemployment rate, while still elevated, declined a little further. Overall consumer price inflation increased somewhat, primarily reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline, but measures of long-run inflation expectations remained stable. The unemployment rate declined to 8.2 percent in March. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons also moved down, but the rate of long-duration unemployment remained elevated. Private nonfarm employment rose at a slower pace in March than in the preceding three months, while total government employment was little changed in recent months after declining last year. Some indicators of job openings and firms<U+0092> hiring plans improved. After being roughly flat over most of the intermeeting period, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose moderately toward the end of the period but remained at a level consistent with further moderate job gains in the coming months. Manufacturing production expanded, on net, in February and March, while the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was essentially unchanged. In recent months, the production of motor vehicles continued to rise appreciably in response to both higher vehicle sales and dealers<U+0092> additions to relatively low levels of inventories; output gains in other industries also were solid and widespread. Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to step up further in the second quarter, and broader indicators of manufacturing activity, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were at levels con- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee sistent with moderate increases in factory output in the second quarter. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose briskly in February, even though households<U+0092> real disposable incomes declined. In March, nominal retail sales excluding purchases of motor vehicles increased solidly, while motor vehicle sales fell off a little from their brisk pace in the previous month. Consumer sentiment was little changed, on balance, in March and early April and remained subdued. Some measures of home prices rose in January and February, but activity in the housing market continued to be held down by the large inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties and by tight underwriting standards for mortgage loans. Starts of new singlefamily homes fell back in February and March to a level more in line with permit issuance; starts were apparently boosted by unseasonably warm weather in December and January. Moreover, sales of new and existing homes edged down, on net, in recent months. Real business expenditures on equipment and software appeared to rise modestly in the first quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in February and March after declining in January; new orders for these capital goods increased, on balance, in February and March, and they continued to run above the level of shipments. The buildup of unfilled orders in recent months, along with improvements in survey measures of capital spending plans and some other forward-looking indicators, pointed toward a pickup in the pace of expenditures for business equipment. In contrast, nominal business spending for nonresidential construction declined in January and February. Inventories in most industries looked to be fairly well aligned with sales in recent months, although motor vehicle stocks were still relatively lean. Data for federal government spending in recent months indicated that real defense expenditures rose modestly in the first quarter. Real state and local government purchases appeared to be about flat last quarter, as the payrolls of these governments edged up in the first quarter and their nominal construction spending declined slightly, on net, in January and February. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in February as exports rose and imports fell. The export gains were concentrated in services. Exports of goods declined largely because of a decrease in exports of automotive products. The drop in imports reflected significant declines in imports of petroleum products, automotive products, capital goods, and consumer goods. Imports from China were especially weak, which may in part reflect seasonal adjustment issues related to the timing of the Chinese New Year. Overall U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, rose at a somewhat faster rate in February than in the preceding six months. In March, prices measured by the consumer price index increased at that same faster pace. Consumer energy prices climbed markedly in February and March, although survey data indicated that gasoline prices stepped down in the first half of April. Meanwhile, increases in consumer food prices were relatively subdued in recent months. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose moderately in February and March. Near-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers increased in March but then fell back in early April, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey remained stable. Available measures of labor compensation indicated that nominal wage gains continued to be muted. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose modestly in March, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier remained low. Recent indicators suggested that foreign economic activity improved on balance in the first quarter, but there were important differences across economies. In the euro area, economic indicators pointed to weakening activity as financial stresses worsened, whereas in the emerging market economies, recent data were consistent with continued expansion. Readings on foreign inflation eased, although they were still relatively high in some Latin American countries. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Broad financial market conditions changed little, on balance, since the March FOMC meeting. However, asset prices fluctuated substantially over the period, apparently in response to the evolving views on the U.S. and global economic outlook and changing expectations regarding the future course of monetary policy. Yields on nominal Treasury securities moved up early in the period, reportedly as investors read incoming information, including the March FOMC statement and minutes along with the results of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), as suggesting a somewhat stronger economic outlook than previously expected. Over subsequent weeks, however, yields drifted lower in response to disappointing economic news and increased concerns about the strains in Eu- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 24<U+0096>25, 2012 Page 3 rope. On net, nominal Treasury yields finished the period slightly lower and measures of the expected path for the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swap (OIS) rates moved down. Conditions in unsecured short-term dollar funding markets were stable over most of the intermeeting period despite the increase in concerns about Europe in the latter part of the period. In secured funding markets, the overnight general collateral Treasury repurchase agreement rate declined for a time late in the period, reportedly in response to the seasonal reduction in Treasury bill issuance in April, but ended the period roughly unchanged. Broad U.S. stock price indexes followed the general pattern observed across asset markets, rising early in the period on increased investor optimism and then falling later on, to end the period little changed on net. Equity prices of financial institutions increased, reportedly as investors interpreted the first-quarter earnings of several large banking organizations and the results of the CCAR as better than expected. Yields and spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged, but yields and spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds increased somewhat. Businesses continued to raise substantial amounts of funds in credit and capital markets over recent months. Bond issuance by financial firms picked up further in March from the strong pace recorded in the previous two months. Domestic nonfinancial firms<U+0092> bond issuance and growth in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans were robust in the first quarter. Leveraged loan issuance was brisk over this period as well, reportedly supported by investor demand for newly issued collateralized loan obligations as well as by interest from pension funds and other institutional investors. Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms stayed strong in March. In contrast, financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector remained strained amid weak fundamentals and tight underwriting conditions, and issuance of commercial mortgagebacked securities in the first quarter of 2012 was below that of a year ago. With respect to credit to households, developments over the intermeeting period were mixed. Although mortgage rates remained near their historical lows, mortgage refinancing activity was subdued, and conditions in residential mortgage markets continued to be weak. By contrast, consumer credit rose at a solid pace, on balance, in recent months; nonrevolving credit, particularly student loans, expanded. Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities (ABS) edged up in recent months, supported by auto-loan ABS issuance. Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was subdued in the first quarter. The ratio of general obligation municipal bond yields to yields on comparablematurity Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeeting period, and the average spreads on credit default swaps for debt issued by states declined on net. Bank credit slowed in March but expanded at a solid pace in the first quarter as a whole. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in April indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic banks eased slightly their lending standards on core loans<U+0097>C&I, real estate, and consumer loans<U+0097>and experienced somewhat stronger demand for such loans in the first quarter of 2012. C&I loans at domestic banks continued to expand in March, with growth concentrated at large domestic banks. Banks<U+0092> holdings of closed-end residential mortgage loans expanded, while home equity loans and CRE loans continued to decline. Consumer loans on banks<U+0092> books rose modestly in March. M2 expanded at a moderate pace in March, reflecting growth in liquid deposits and currency that was only partially offset by declines in small time deposits and in balances in retail money market funds. Financial strains within the euro area increased over the intermeeting period. Spreads of yields on sovereign Italian and Spanish debt over those on comparablematurity German bonds rose, amid official warnings that Spain would miss its fiscal target for this year and would need to make further budget cuts, as well as renewed concerns in the market about the prospects for Spanish banks. Although the spread of the threemonth euro London interbank offered rate over the comparable OIS rate narrowed on balance over the period, euro-area bank equity indexes dropped sharply, driven by declines in the share prices of Spanish and Italian banks. Five-year credit default swap premiums rose for a broad range of euro-area banks, especially Spanish banks. Against the background of these increased stresses within the euro area, foreign equity indexes declined and corporate credit spreads widened. The staff<U+0092>s broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting period as the dollar appreciated against most emerging market currencies but depreciated moderately against the yen and sterling. Amid some volatility, yields on _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee benchmark sovereign bonds for Germany and Japan ended the period somewhat lower. Monetary policy abroad remained generally accommodative. The total outstanding amount on the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s dollar liquidity swap lines declined to $32 billion, down from $65 billion at the time of the March FOMC meeting; demand for dollars fell at the lending operations of the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National Bank. Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, the staff revised up slightly its near-term projection for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, reflecting that the unemployment rate was a little lower, the level of overall payroll employment a bit higher, and consumer spending noticeably stronger than the staff had expected at the time of the previous forecast. However, the staff<U+0092>s medium-term projection for real GDP growth in the April forecast was little changed from the one presented in March. The staff continued to project that real GDP would accelerate gradually through 2014, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment. Increases in economic activity were expected to be sufficient to decrease the wide margin of slack in the labor market slowly over the projection period, but the unemployment rate was anticipated to still be elevated at the end of 2014. The staff<U+0092>s forecast for inflation over the projection period was just a bit above the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting somewhat higher-than-expected data on core consumer prices and a slightly narrower margin of economic slack than in the March forecast. However, with the pass-through of the recent run-up in crude oil prices into consumer energy prices seen as nearly complete, oil prices expected to edge lower from current levels, substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, and stable long-run inflation expectations, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014. Participants<U+0092> Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants<U+0097>the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC<U+0097>submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant<U+0092>s judgment of appropriate monetary policy. The longer-run projections represent each participant<U+0092>s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in more detail in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that the information received since the Committee<U+0092>s previous meeting suggested that the economy continued to expand moderately. Labor market conditions improved in recent months. So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment continued to expand. There were signs of improvement in the housing sector, but from a very low level of activity. Despite some volatility in financial markets over the intermeeting period, financial conditions in U.S. markets continued to improve; bank credit quality and loan demand both increased. Mainly reflecting the increase in the prices of crude oil and gasoline earlier this year, inflation had picked up somewhat. However, longer-term inflation expectations remained stable. Participants<U+0092> assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually. Reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth, most anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. The incoming information led some participants to become more confident about the durability of the recovery. However, others thought it was premature to infer a stronger underlying trend from the recent positive indicators, since those readings may partially reflect the effects of the mild winter weather or other temporary influences. A number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth in some foreign economies, prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, slow household income growth, and<U+0097>notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement<U+0097>ongoing weakness in the housing market. Participants continued to expect most of the factors restraining economic expansion to ease over time and so anticipated that the re- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 24<U+0096>25, 2012 Page 5 covery would gradually gain strength. The strains in global financial markets, though generally less pronounced than last fall, continued to pose a significant risk to the outlook, and the possibility of a sharp fiscal tightening in the United States was also considered a sizable risk. Most participants anticipated that inflation would fall back from recent elevated levels as the effects of higher energy prices waned, and still expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate. However, other participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook given the recent pickup in inflation and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. In discussing the household sector, meeting participants generally noted that consumer spending continued to expand moderately, notwithstanding high gasoline prices. The recent strengthening in the pace of light motor vehicle sales was attributed to both pent-up demand and the desire for increased fuel efficiency in the wake of higher gasoline prices. Looking forward, increases in household wealth from the rise in equity prices, improving consumer sentiment, and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as helping to support continued increases in household expenditures, notwithstanding sluggish growth in real disposable income and restrictive fiscal policies. Recent housing-sector indicators, including sales and starts, suggested some upward movement, but some participants saw the improvement as likely related to unusually warm winter weather in much of the country. Overall, the level of activity in the sector remained depressed. House prices appeared to be stabilizing but had not yet begun to rise in most markets. Most participants anticipated that the housing sector was likely to recover only slowly over time, but a few were more optimistic about the potential for a more rapid housing recovery given reports of stronger demand in some regions and of improved sentiment among builders, as well as signs that recent changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program were contributing to the refinancing of performing high loan-to-value mortgages. Reports from business contacts indicated that activity in the manufacturing, energy, and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months. Auto production had picked up in light of strengthening demand. Business contacts suggested that sentiment was improving, but many firms remained somewhat cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity or gain market share rather than to expand capacity. Reportedly, this caution reflected in part continued uncertainty about the strength and durability of the economic recovery, as well as about government policies. Participants expected that the government sector would be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters. They generally saw the U.S. fiscal situation also as a risk to the economic outlook; if agreement is not reached on a plan for the federal budget, a sharp fiscal tightening could occur at the start of 2013. Several participants indicated that uncertainty about the trajectory of future fiscal policy could lead businesses to defer hiring and investment. It was noted that agreement on a longer-term plan to address the country<U+0092>s fiscal challenges would help to alleviate uncertainty and consequent negative effects on consumer and business sentiment. Exports have supported U.S. growth so far this year; however, some participants noted risks to the export picture from economic weakness in Europe or from a more significant slowdown in the pace of expansion in China and emerging Asia. Labor market conditions continued to improve, although unusually warm weather may have inflated payroll job figures somewhat earlier this year. Contacts in some parts of the country said that highly qualified workers were in short supply; overall, however, wage pressures had been limited so far. The decline in labor force participation, which has been sharpest for younger workers, has been a factor in the nearly 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate since last August, a drop that was larger than would have been predicted from the historical relationship between real GDP growth and changes in the unemployment rate. Assessing the extent to which the changes in labor force participation reflect cyclical factors that will be reversed once the recovery picks up, as opposed to changes in the trend rate of participation, was seen as important for understanding unemployment dynamics going forward. One participant cited research suggesting that about half of the decline in labor force participation had reflected cyclical factors, and thus, as participation picks up, unemployment may decline more slowly in coming quarters compared with the recent pace. Another posited that the strength in payroll job growth in recent months may be a one-time reaction to the sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009 and that future job gains may be somewhat weaker unless the pace of economic growth increases. Participants expressed a range _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee of views on the extent to which the unemployment rate was being boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those being demanded by hiring firms. A few participants acknowledged there could be structural factors at work, but said that in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that unemployment was still elevated. Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand. A few participants noted that current measures of labor market slack would be overstated if structural factors accounted for a large portion of the current high levels of unemployment. As a result, such measures might be an unreliable guide as to how close the economy was to maximum employment. These participants pointed out that, over time, estimates of the potential level of output have declined, reducing, as a consequence, estimates of the level of economic slack. Some participants cited the recent rise in inflation, abstracting from the direct effect of the rise in energy prices, as supportive of the view that the level of slack was lower than some believe. Participants judged that, in general, conditions in domestic credit markets had continued to improve since the March FOMC meeting. Bank credit quality and consumer and business loan demand were increasing, although commercial and residential real estate lending remained relatively weak. U.S. equity prices had risen early in the intermeeting period but subsequently declined, ending the period little changed on net; investment-grade corporate bond yields were flat to down slightly and remained at very low levels. Many U.S. financial institutions had been taking steps to bolster their resiliency, including increasing capital levels and liquidity buffers, and reducing their European exposures. A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns. In contrast to improved conditions in domestic credit markets, investors<U+0092> concerns about the sovereign debt and banking situation in the euro area intensified during the intermeeting period. Some participants said they thought the policy actions taken in Europe would most likely ease stress in financial markets, but some expressed the view that a longer-term solution to the banking and fiscal problems in the euro area would require substantial further adjustment in the banking and public sectors. Participants expected that global financial markets would remain focused on the evolving situation in Europe. Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year. In recent weeks, oil prices had begun to fall and readings from the oil futures market suggested this may continue; non-energy commodity prices had remained relatively stable. Several participants noted that increases in labor costs continued to be subdued. With longer-run inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, most participants anticipated that after the temporary effect of the rise in oil and gasoline prices had run its course, inflation would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate. Overall, most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced. However, some participants saw a risk that inflation pressures could increase as the expansion continued; they pointed to the fact that inflation was currently above target and were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation partly because of the difficulty in measuring slack, especially in real time. These participants were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run could erode the stability of inflation expectations and risk higher inflation. In this regard, one participant noted the potential risks and costs associated with additional balance sheet actions. In their discussion of the economic outlook and policy, some participants noted the potential usefulness of simple monetary policy rules, of the type the Committee regularly reviews, as guides for monetary policy decisionmaking and for external communications about policy. These participants suggested that because such rules give an indication of how policy should systematically respond to changes in economic conditions they might help clarify the relationship between appropriate monetary policy and the evolution of the economic outlook. While acknowledging that there could be differences across participants in the type of rules they might favor<U+0097>for example, one participant expressed a preference for rules based on growth rates rather than output gaps because of measurement issues<U+0097>a few participants indicated that the likely degree of commonality across participants was suggestive that this might be a promising approach to explore. However, a few other participants were more skeptical. One thought that, while prescriptions from rules might provide useful benchmarks, applying the rules mechanically and _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 24<U+0096>25, 2012 Page 7 with little thought about the embedded assumptions would be counterproductive. Another participant questioned the value of interest rate rules when the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and unconventional policy options are being used, but others indicated they believed the rules could be appropriately adjusted to account for these factors. Interest was expressed in examining the usefulness of simple policy rules in a more normal environment, as well as in the current environment in which the policy rate is at the zero lower bound and large-scale asset purchases and the maturity extension program have been implemented. Participants planned to discuss further, at a future meeting, the potential merits and drawbacks of using simple rules as guides to monetary policy decisionmaking and for communications. Committee Policy Action Members viewed the information on U.S. economic activity received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately and generally agreed that the economic outlook was broadly similar to that at the time of their March meeting. Labor market conditions had improved in recent months, and the unemployment rate had fallen, but almost all of the members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee<U+0092>s mandate. Growth was expected to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up over time. Members expected the unemployment rate to decline gradually. Strains in global financial markets stemming from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad. The possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy would be more contractionary than anticipated and that uncertainty about fiscal policy could lead to a deferral of hiring and investment were other downside risks. Recent readings indicated that inflation remained above the Committee<U+0092>s 2 percent longer-run target, primarily reflecting the increase in oil and gasoline prices seen earlier in the year. With longer-term inflation expectations stable, most members anticipated that the increase in inflation would prove temporary and that subsequently inflation would run at or below the rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate. However, one member thought that there were upside risks to inflation, especially if the current degree of highly accommodative monetary policy were maintained much beyond this year. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, the Committee members reached the collective judgment that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. In particular, the Committee agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to <U+00BC> percent, to continue the program of extending the average maturity of the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s holdings of securities as announced last September, and to retain the existing policies regarding the reinvestment of principal payments from Federal Reserve holdings of securities. With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that only relatively small modifications to the first two paragraphs were needed to reflect the incoming economic data and the modest changes to the economic outlook. With the economic outlook over the medium term not greatly changed, almost all of the members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions<U+0097>including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run<U+0097>are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. Most members continued to anticipate that the unemployment rate would still be well above their estimates of its longer-run level, and inflation would be at or below the Committee<U+0092>s longer-run objective, in late 2014. Some Committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of downside risks to growth, especially since the Committee<U+0092>s ability to respond to weakerthan-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is near the zero lower bound. The need to compensate for a substantial period during which the policy rate was constrained by the zero bound was also cited by a few members as a possible reason to maintain a very low level of the federal funds rate for a longer period than would otherwise be the case. While almost all of the members agreed that the change in the outlook over the intermeeting period was insufficient to warrant an adjustment to the Committee<U+0092>s forward guidance, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts, it was noted that the forward guidance is conditional on economic developments and that the date given in the statement would be subject to revision should there be a significant change in the economic outlook. Some members recalled that gains in employment strengthened in early _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee 2010 and again in early 2011 only to diminish as those years progressed; moreover, the uncertain effects of the unusually mild winter weather were cited as making it harder to discern the underlying trend in the economic data. They viewed these factors as reinforcing the case for leaving the forward guidance unchanged at this meeting and preferred adjusting the forward guidance only once they were more confident that the mediumterm economic outlook or risks to the outlook had changed significantly. In contrast, another member thought that the forward guidance should be more responsive to changes in economic developments; that member suggested that the Committee would need to determine the appropriate threshold for altering the guidance. The Committee also stated that it will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Several members indicated that additional monetary policy accommodation could be necessary if the economic recovery lost momentum or the downside risks to the forecast became great enough. Committee members discussed the desirability of providing more clarity about the economic conditions that would likely warrant maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and those that would indicate that a change in monetary policy was appropriate. Doing so might help the public better understand the conditionality in the Committee<U+0092>s forward guidance. The Committee also discussed the relationship between the Committee<U+0092>s statement, which expresses the collective view of the Committee, and the policy projections of individual participants, which are included in the SEP. The Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to consider possible enhancements and refinements to the SEP that might help better clarify the link between economic developments and the Committee<U+0092>s view of the appropriate stance of monetary policy. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: <U+0093>The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to <U+00BC> percent. The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it began in September to purchase, by the end of June 2012, Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of $400 billion, and to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less with a total face value of $400 billion. The Committee also directs the Desk to maintain its existing policies of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities in order to maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s agency MBS transactions. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System<U+0092>s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee<U+0092>s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.<U+0094> The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: <U+0093>Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately. Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain mod- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of April 24<U+0096>25, 2012 Page 9 erate over coming quarters then to pick up gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to <U+00BC> percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions<U+0097> including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run<U+0097>are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securi ties holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.<U+0094> Voting for this action: Ben Bernanke, William C. Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Dennis P. Lockhart, Sandra Pianalto, Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, John C. Williams, and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against this action: Jeffrey M. Lacker. Mr. Lacker dissented because he did not believe that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate through late 2014. In his view, an increase in the federal funds rate was likely to be necessary by mid-2013 to prevent the emergence of inflationary pressures. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday<U+0096>Wednesday, June 19<U+0096>20, 2012. Because some participants had expressed a preference for the two-day format over the one-day format for FOMC meetings, the Chairman raised the possibility of revising the FOMC meeting schedule to incorporate more two-day meetings to allow additional time for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 11:10 a.m. on April 25, 2012.","04","12",1

"The decision on the reference interest rate takes into account that the forecast models predict that inflation would be around the target in the monetary policy horizon.

Credit to the private sector in national currency would be growing at an annual rate of around 6% in March, lower than the projected growth in nominal GDP for the end of the year. In April, the monthly variation of loans to the private sector in national currency showed a slowdown with respect to what was observed in the first three months of the year. Other variables, such as domestic imports, also show a downward trend, registering a fall of 5.7% during the first quarter of the year.","04","13",5

In the Eurozone, the outlook for moderate recovery remains around 1.2% for 2014, according to the Consensus Forecast. Emerging economies continue to project a lower rate of expansion than in previous years. In the case of Latin America, the consensus points to 2.3% growth for 2014, in an environment of reduced terms of trade in the region and lower liquidity in international markets. In recent months, the prices of some raw materials, particularly oil and food, have remained stable.

At the same time, credit to the private sector in national currency expanded above 14.5% at the end of March and it is expected that it would be growing at a rate close to 10.0% at the end of the year, a rhythm consistent with the expected path in GDP nominal. Additionally, the influx of foreign currency into the economy would be improving due to the entry of important resources from the recent placement of the sovereign bond, to a more favorable behavior of exports of goods and services and remittances, given the improvement in the economy of our main business partner.

"In terms of inflation, pressures on prices would remain moderate in advanced economies, with rates estimated at 2.5% in 2018 and 2.4% in 2019 for the US and 1.5% and 1.6% in those years for the EZ. In Latin America, average inflation, excluding Venezuela, would close the year at around 5.9%, according to Consensus Forecast.","04","18",4
"As a result of better international economic performance, among other factors, prices of primary goods, mainly oil, have maintained their upward trend in the first half of the year. In that sense, the average price of a barrel of oil is around US $ 64 so far this year and it is expected to be gradually reduced, converging to about US $ 60 / barrel at the end of 2018.","04","18",5
"In the domestic context, economic activity continues to evolve favorably in the short term. Taking into account the evolution of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity during the first two months of the year, the real product would expand above its potential in the first quarter, in a favorable international context and a domestic environment where the effects of the monetary stimulus remain of last year. In this regard, loans to the private sector in local currency grew around 13.5% year-on-year to the month of April, while monetary aggregates presented growth rates consistent with this credit expansion.","04","18",6
"On the fiscal policy side, government revenues have remained above the amount budgeted during the first four months of the year, improving the outlook for compliance with the fiscal deficit target of 2.2% of GDP established in the 2018. In the external sector, dynamism continues in foreign exchange generating activities, such as tourism, remittances and foreign direct investment, which facilitates the relative stability of the foreign exchange market and the strengthening of international reserves.","04","18",7
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy aimed at achieving the inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability. In this sense, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy, as well as the main risks in the domestic context, in order to adopt the necessary measures in the face of possible effects on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","04","18",8
"BCRD keeps its monetary policy rate at 5.50% per year","04","19",1
"At its monetary policy meeting in April 2019, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.50% per annum.","04","19",2
"The decision to leave the benchmark rate unchanged is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including information from international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. Inflation for march 2019 was 0.65%, so cumulative inflation in the first three months of the year stood at 0.86%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation stood at 1.47% in March, while underlying inflation, which excludes prices for the most volatile components, stood at 2.15%. The BCRD's forecasting system and market expectations indicate that overall inflation would remain low, gradually approaching the centre of the target range of 4.0% - 1.0% over the two-year monetary policy horizon.","04","19",3
"In the international environment, trade war in larger economies, coupled with geopolitical tensions and increased uncertainty in international financial markets, led to a downward revision of global growth. In this regard, Consensus Forecast estimated that the world economy would grow 2.7% in 2019 and 2.8% by 2020. The performance of advanced economies continues to be boosted by the United States of America, expanding by 3.2% during the first quarter of 2019. However, signs of a gradual slowdown in the US persist, projecting growth of 2.4% in 2019 and 2.0% by 2020. This context of lower growth in the U.S., coupled with low inflationary pressures led to a pause in the Federal Reserve's monetary normalization. Moreover, market analyst projections point to a possible reduction in the EDF's monetary policy rate this year.","04","19",4
"On the other hand, in the face of a moderation in the growth of large economies such as France, Germany and Italy, the growth prospects for the Eurozone (EEG) continue to be downwards. Consensus Forecast estimates expansions of 1.1% and 1.3% for 2019 and 2020, respectively. The projections also indicate that ZE inflation would remain below its target for years to come. In this way, the European Central Bank would exhibit a more expansive-than-expected monetary policy stance by keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged and through new programmes to stimulate the channeling of credit to the private sector through financial institutions. In this regard, international financial conditions would remain favourable for emerging economies.","04","19",5
"In Latin America, growth forecasts have also been revised downwards by 1.6% for 2019 and recovering to 2.5% by 2020. Within the region, economies contrast with strong macroeconomic fundamentals with those that would remain in recession such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua, while other major economies in the region such as Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador and Uruguay would grow below 2.0% this year.","04","19",6
"In terms of raw materials, the price of oil has shown a gradual upward trend since the beginning of the year associated with lower supply in the face of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and economic sanctions on oil-producing countries such as Iran and Venezuela. The average price of Texas Intermediate Oil (WTI) barrel is expected to be around $60.0 this year, in line with the National Budget.","04","19",7
"In the domestic context, the Monthly Economic Activity Indicator (IMAE) notes that the Dominican economy continues to grow above its potential, with a year-on-year expansion of 5.9% in the January-February period of this year, driven mainly by investment and private consumption. The dynamism of domestic demand, coupled with favourable monetary conditions, has contributed to the continued growth of credit to the private sector in national currency at year-on-year rates of around 10.0%.","04","19",8
"With regard to fiscal policy, there is a balanced balance sheet of the Non-Financial Public Sector in the first two months of the year, with a primary surplus expected to be maintained during 2019, as envisaged in the National Budget. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities maintain remarkable dynamism, highlighting tourism, remittances and foreign direct investment; which has contributed to the relative stability of the exchange rate and facilitating the accumulation of international reserves.","04","19",9
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic remains attentive to the evolution of international financial conditions and the dynamics of the price of oil at a global level, as well as the potential impact of climate phenomena on the domestic economy, being prepared to react in a timely manner to any factor that may generate inflationary diversions. In this regard, the issuing body reaffirms its commitment to driving monetary policy towards the achievement of its inflation target and the smooth functioning of the financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.","04","19",10
"BCRD keeps its monetary policy rate at 3.50% per year","04","20",1
"At its monetary policy meeting in April 2020, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 3.50% per annum. In addition, the interest rate for the permanent ease of expansion (Repos to 1 day) remains at 4.50% per annum, while the interest rate on paid deposits (Overnight) stands at 2.50% per annum.","04","20",2
"The decision on the benchmark rate is based on a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the current uncertainty on macroeconomic stability and future inflation developments. In this sense, the monthly inflation of March was -0.52 %, while the inflation accumulated during the first three months of the year was -0.32%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from March 2019 to March 2020, moderated to 2.45%, below the target range of 4.0% to 1.0%, while the underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, reached 2.67%. Moving forward, the BCRD forecasting system indicates that inflation would remain below the lower bound of the target range for the remainder of 2020. Low inflationary pressures give the BCRD greater degrees of freedom to continue reacting in a timely manner to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the Dominican economy, if necessary.","04","20",3
"In the international environment, the accelerated spread of coronavirus has forced strong containment measures, which would have a significant negative impact on global economic activity. As a result, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its Report World Economic Outlook published in April, decreased global growth projections from 2.9% in 2019 to -3.0% in 2020. In response to the deterioration in global growth, central banks around the world have taken monetary easing and liquidity provision measures to support their countries' domestic demands.","04","20",4
"In the United States of America (USA), the IMF projects that economic activity would contract this year, ranging from an expansion of 2.3% in 2019 to -5.9% by 2020. Indeed, preliminary estimates indicate that growth in the U.S. economy moderated to 0.3% year-on-year during the first quarter, influenced by a fall in consumption and private investment. In this context of uncertainty, high stock market volatility and low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve (Fed) reduced the federal funds rate by 150 basis points during the month of March, placing it in the range of 0% - 0.25%. In addition, the Fed expanded its liquidity provision programs to the financial system through Repos to varying terms of up to 90 days, purchases on the secondary market of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities and credit channeling programs for small and medium-sized enterprises through financial institutions.","04","20",5
"As for the Euro Zone, the IMF projects that COVID-19 will cause an even greater contraction in this bloc of countries, moving from 1.2% growth in 2019 to -7.5% by 2020. In response to the impact of coronavirus, the European Central Bank keeps the rate of short-term deposits (Overnight) at -0.50% per annum, while extending the liquidity provision programme for private credit pipeline through financial institutions and expanding the purchase of public and private securities on the secondary market.","04","20",6
"On the other hand, Latin America, which was already facing a weakened economic situation, has been simultaneously affected by the impact of coronavirus and falling commodity prices, causing a reduction in the regional growth outlook to -5.2% by 2020. In this context, the central banks of Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica have lowered their interest rates this year, as well as taking additional liquidity provision measures through financial institutions.","04","20",7
"In relation to raw materials, a substantial reduction in the price of Texas intermediate oil has been observed due to a combination of low demand and increased inventories, placing below $15 a barrel at the end of April. By contrast, the price of gold has increased, ranking around $1,700 per troy ounce, when it is used as a value haven in an environment of high uncertainty. The price dynamics of primary goods implies an improvement in terms of trade for the Dominican Republic which is reflected in a decrease in the oil turnover and an increase in gold exports, which along with the flow of remittances received during the first quarter of the year exceeding US$1.7 billion and the growth of domestic and free zone exports , partially offset the impact of COVID-19 on the external sector.","04","20",8
"Importantly, at the time of the pandemic containment measures in the Dominican Republic, the economy was in a favourable cyclical position, characterized by economic growth around potential and low inflationary pressures, giving it the flexibility to accommodate this adverse shock through the adoption of expansive monetary measures aimed at boosting domestic demand. Indeed, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates a marked slowdown during the month of March in relation to the pace of expansion observed in January and February, although the economy would not be recording negative growth during the first quarter of the year in the face of the impact of COVID-19.","04","20",9
"In this context, the Central Bank has adopted in March and April a set of monetary and financial measures aimed at preserving economic stability and mitigating the effects of coronavirus through increased financing for productive sectors and households at lower interest rates. In particular, of the total RD$100 billion that has been made available to financial intermediation entities, some RD$50 billion have been channelled through different facilities. Of this amount, some RD$10 billion correspond to private loans granted through the release of resources from the legal lace and some RD$40 billion to provision liquidity to financial intermediation entities through Repos up to 90 days.","04","20",10
"It is emphasized that, even under current conditions of high uncertainty, legal lace resources are being channelled at a faster rate than all previous occasions when this monetary policy instrument has been used. In addition, there has also been a significant reduction of around 300 basis points in interest rates on loans granted by multiple banks during the month of April and greater dynamism in monetary aggregates.","04","20",11
"These favourable monetary conditions have contributed to an acceleration of credit to the private sector expanding by around 13% year-on-year, highlighting the channelling of loans to the Manufacturing, Hotels and Restaurants, Construction and Commerce sectors. The dynamism of private credit increases access to working capital for sectors currently operating at full capacity and provides greater liquidity to those activities suspended by the pandemic. It is important to note that the Central Bank has the necessary space to continue to support the productive sectors and households, once the sanitary conditions allow for a process of gradual normalization of the economy, and facilitate a rapid recovery in domestic demand.","04","20",12
"On the other hand, it should be noted that the approval of the disbursement of some US$650 million as emergency financial assistance by the IMF, equivalent to 100% of the country's share in this multilateral body, will help the Dominican government continue to face the challenges posed by COVID-19. Access to these resources, together with the Central Bank's $622 million foreign currency liquidity provision measures and the Central Bank's high levels of international reserves, will help maintain relative exchange rate stability in the face of a convulsing international environment.","04","20",13
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the institution will continue to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on the Dominican economy, being prepared to continue reacting in a timely manner to factors that may lead to deviations from the inflation target and affect economic growth.","04","20",14
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, at its Monetary Policy Meeting of May 2012 decided, effective June 1, to reduce its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (Overnight) by 75 basis points, from 6.75% to 6.0% per annum. At the same time, it decided to reduce the Lombard Rate by 100 basis points, from 9.0% to 8.0% annually. With this decision, the policy rate corridor narrows.","05","12",1
"The decision regarding the benchmark interest rate is based on the fact that in a passive scenario, projections point to an inflation rate below the lower limit of the target for this year. In fact, in the month of April, the interannual rate of inflation was 4.0%, below the goal that this year was established at 5.5% <U+00B1> 1%. Core interannual inflation, which is associated with monetary inflationary pressures, fell to 3.7%, its lowest level in the last two years. The forecast models indicate that no significant inflationary pressures are expected in the monetary policy horizon.","05","12",2
"In the external context, the growth of the US economy continues to be moderate, while increasing uncertainty about how the European Union would solve its financial and fiscal sustainability problems, strengthening the prospects for weak economic growth for that area. On the other hand, in recent months emerging economies have shown a more modest performance than anticipated, although growth expectations remain positive, particularly in emerging Asia and Latin America. The moderation in global economic activity and the greater uncertainty about the European crisis have contributed to reversing the upward trend observed in the prices of raw materials at the beginning of the year. In that sense, the international price of oil has been reduced since last March, falling below the forecasts of the Economic Consensus and the IMF for the current year.","05","12",3
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity continues to show a moderate performance, growing around 4% during the first quarter of the year, a rate below its potential. The current levels of interest rates and expectations created by the electoral cycle have slowed the rate of growth of credit to the private sector in national currency, which has been below the nominal GDP growth forecast for the current year. Despite the external situation, the performance of the export sector continues to improve, while the growth of imports has moderated and a higher-than-expected increase in foreign direct investment is projected. These factors help to relieve pressures on external accounts. Regarding market inflation expectations, economic surveys show a more positive scenario with inflation forecasts in the target range, both for 2012 and 2013.","05","12",4
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2012, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to react in a timely manner to risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","05","12",5
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monetary Policy Meeting of May 2013, decided to reduce its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (MPR) from 5.00% to 4.25%. . This is the first reduction of the MPR since August 2012. According to the new short-term liquidity management scheme of the Central Bank, the interest rates of permanent expansion and monetary contraction facilities will decrease to 6.25% and 2.25% annual, respectively.","05","13",1
"The decision on the benchmark interest rate takes into account that the forecast models indicate that there will be no major inflationary pressures in the coming months and no deviations from inflation are expected with respect to its target in the monetary policy horizon. On the other hand, production is below its potential capacity and during the quarter January-March recorded a growth rate below the average of recent years, as a result of the weakness that domestic demand has been showing. Macroeconomic models indicate that, if measures are not taken, production will remain below its potential until the end of 2014. Market inflation expectations are located around the objective of the Monetary Program.","05","13",2
"In terms of price data, in April the monthly inflation rate was -0.06%, while in accumulated terms it reached 1.9% in the first four months of the year. The year-on-year inflation rate fell to 4.9% in April, influenced by the negative inflation of that month. Additionally, the interannual core inflation stood at 5.0%, also presenting a downward trend with respect to the previous month.","05","13",3
"In the external context, the Euro Zone remains in recession, registering a fall in its economic activity of 0.8% in the first quarter of the year. The United States of America, on the other hand, achieved 2.5% growth in the same period, which confirms the moderate recovery trend that this economy has been exhibiting since the end of 2011. According to the Consensus Forecast, the economies of the Euro Zone and The US would present growth of around -0.5% and 1.9% at the end of the year, respectively. In Japan, the recent measures of monetary expansion have brought optimism in that economy, but China and other important emerging economies have shown signs of slowdown, reflecting the latter in a fall in the prices of primary goods, especially minerals. International financial conditions have improved, despite the fragility of the fiscal situation in some industrialized economies.","05","13",4
"In the domestic sphere, the economic activity measured by the Real Gross Domestic Product grew 0.3% in the first quarter, reflecting a notable weakness in domestic demand and an excess supply of goods and services. However, credit to the private sector in national currency would be accelerating, influenced by the recent measures to liberalize reserve requirements, which has allowed year-on-year growth of private loans in national currency of over 8% in May. The expansion of private credit indicated is in line with the projection of nominal GDP growth for the year end of 8.2%. As for the external sector, exports would be growing due to the increase in mining exports. This, combined with the drop in imports of goods and services and the reduction in the value of the oil bill, would allow an improvement in the current account of the balance of payments by the end of the year.","05","13",5
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target. At the same time, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to adopt, if necessary, new measures that contribute to boost credit and stimulate domestic demand, provided that they do not jeopardize price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","05","13",6
"At its May 2014 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate unchanged at 6.25% per annum.","05","14",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate took into account the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as market expectations on the main macroeconomic variables. In April, the interannual rate of inflation amounted to 3.49%, placing itself at the lower end of the target range for 2014 of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1%. Accumulated inflation in the first four months of the year was 1.53%. On the other hand, core interannual inflation, which is related to monetary conditions, was 3.39% at the end of April.","05","14",2
"In the external sphere, the recovery prospects of the developed economies and a modest performance of the developing countries remain. However, in the face of extreme weather conditions, the United States of America revised its inter-annual growth from the first quarter downwards from 2.3% to 2.0%. Regarding the growth forecast for the end of the year, Consensus Forecast modified its estimate from 2.7% to 2.5%. On the other hand, the Euro Zone shows a growth of 0.9% in the first quarter, driven by a 2.3% expansion of the German economy. Low inflationary pressures in industrialized countries anticipate the maintenance of low international interest rates for an extended period, while the financial conditions faced by emerging economies tend to improve. The prices of primary goods, particularly oil and food, have remained relatively stable in the last month.","05","14",3
"In the domestic sphere, the trend-cycle of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity expanded by around 6.0% for the month of April, indicating that, if this trend continues, the dynamics of national production could exceed growth projections. At the same time, monetary conditions have improved during the first part of the year. While the monetary aggregates present interannual growth rates of around 10% at the end of May, the financial entities maintain sufficient liquidity to continue channeling resources to the productive sectors. Credit to the private sector in national currency grew around 13.5% year-to-year at the end of May. It is expected that this healthy rate of expansion in private loans will be maintained for the rest of the year in the face of favorable monetary conditions, which, in an environment of growth and inflation projections in the target range, suggests a neutral stance on monetary policy. In the area of ??fiscal accounts, public investment has been reactivated in line with the provisions of the National Budget, while fiscal revenues remain above the estimate. Regarding the external sector, the positive result of the global balance of payments, driven by a current account surplus in the first quarter of the year, anticipates low pressures in the foreign exchange market.","05","14",4

"At its monetary policy meeting in May 2015, the Central Bank (BCRD) decided to reduce its monetary policy interest rate (MPR) for the third consecutive month. On this occasion, it decreased by 25 basis points, from 5.25% to 5.00% per annum, as of June 1, 2015. With this decision, the cumulative reduction of the MPR this year is 125 basis points.","05","15",1
"According to the BCRD short-term liquidity management scheme, the rate of paid deposits (overnight) is reduced from 3.75% to 3.50% per year and the rate of expansion facilities (repos) decreases from 6.75% to 6.50% per annum .","05","15",2
"The decision to reduce the reference rate was adopted after analyzing the national macroeconomic panorama, especially the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as the evolution of the relevant international environment and its impact on market and economic expectations. Dominican It is expected that the policy decision will favorably affect economic growth without putting the inflation target at risk in the policy horizon.","05","15",3
"The interannual inflation rate in April stood at -0.04%, while the accumulated inflation so far this year stood at -0.09%. Additionally, core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, fell in April to 2.37% year-on-year. The projections continue indicating that inflation would remain below the lower limit of the goal for the current year of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%, during 2015.","05","15",4
"Externally, the most recent data on the world economy show little change since last month. The economies of developed countries maintain their recovery process. Consensus Forecast projects growth for the United States of America (USA) around 2.5% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, converging the unemployment rate in the coming months to its full employment level of 5.25%. On the other hand, an expansion is foreseen for the Euro Zone of 1.5% in the current year and 1.8% next year.","05","15",5
"Latin America continues to grow well below its historical average and some of the largest economies, such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, are in recession. According to Consensus Forecast, the region's growth would reach 0.4% in 2015. After several months of decline, oil prices have shown a slight upturn in the last month, although they still remain at levels lower than last year. The US dollar maintains a significant degree of appreciation in interannual terms in the international exchange markets.","05","15",6
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity grew 6.5% in real terms during the first quarter of the year, lower than the rate of 8.1% in the same period last year. Also, in the Financial System, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector in national currency was around 12.0% in May, below the 15.5% expansion rate, reached at the end of last year. . On the fiscal policy side, the budgetary execution of the first quarter presents a surplus balance and suggests that a primary surplus would be obtained by the end of 2015. Additionally, the current account of the balance of payments is projected to register a deficit around to 2.0% of GDP by the end of the year. This level is lower than its historical average and lower than the 3.2% of GDP registered in 2014, which would facilitate relative stability in the foreign exchange market and the accumulation of international reserves over and above what is planned in the Monetary Program.","05","15",7

"At its monetary policy meeting in May 2016, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to maintain the monetary policy rate (MPR) at 5.0% per annum.","05","16",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate took into account the balance of risks around inflation forecasts, market expectations, as well as the recent evolution of the main macroeconomic variables. In April, the interannual rate of inflation was 1.75%, this variable remaining below the lower end of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1% for 2016. The accumulated inflation in the first four months of the year is - 0.67%, while core interannual inflation, which is related to monetary conditions, was 1.51% at the close of the fourth month of the year.","05","16",2
"In the external sphere, the outlook for the world economy, according to the Consensus Forecast, points to a growth of 2.4% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017. In the United States of America (USA), however, Consensus's growth forecast it was adjusted to fall from 2.0% to 1.8% for the current year 2016, expecting a recovery of the economy with an expansion of 2.3% in 2017. In light of these events, the implicit probability of an increase in the monetary policy rate of the FED has increased, judging by the future contracts of the market, reason why a possible increase in the next months is expected. Although a decision of this type could affect the performance of bond placements in international markets, it would also generate an appreciation of the dollar that could cause a further reduction in oil prices. These possible impacts of an increase in the FDM of the FED have, to a large extent, been internalized by the market. In that sense, the eventual increase in the FED's rates should not have a significant short-term effect on the Dominican economy.","05","16",3
"Regarding the economies of other regions of the world, Consensus Forecast maintained its projection of growth for the Euro Zone, which implies that the economy would expand around 1.6%, both in 2016 and in 2017. On the other hand, Latin America (AL) would present a contraction in its gross domestic production of -0.6% in 2016, mainly due to the recession experienced by countries such as Venezuela (-8.6%), Brazil (-3.7%), Ecuador (-1.7%) and Argentina ( -1.1%). It should be noted that other important economies of the region would have positive growth, but below the average of the last 5 years. Such is the case of economies such as Mexico (2.4%), Chile (1.8%), Colombia (2.4%), Costa Rica (3.6%) and Uruguay (1.3%). It is expected that by 2017, the average growth of the LA economies will become positive, reaching an expansion of around 2.0%.","05","16",4
"The prices of primary goods, particularly that of some commodities of importance in foreign trade transactions in the Dominican Republic, have been exhibiting an upward trend in the last two months.

"In the domestic sphere, economic activity continues to show growth above its potential, with a preliminary record of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE), a robust year-on-year expansion of 10.1% in the month of April. During the period January-April, the accumulated growth of the IMAE was 7.1%, compared to the same period last year.

"In the financial sector, credit to the private sector grew around 13.8% in May and is expected to expand at a rate close to 12.0% at the end of the year. With regard to fiscal policy, the Government is expected to comply with the forecast budget deficit for the end of the year at around 2.3% of GDP. In turn, in the external sector, the current account deficit would be around 1.9% of GDP by the end of the year.

On the other hand, core inflation, related to monetary conditions, amounted to 2.16%. According to the most recent projections, inflation would remain within the target range in the policy horizon.","05","17",3
"In the international context, the economy of the United States of America (USA) would be growing around 2.1% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018, according to Consensus Forecast. Also, inflation would be 2.4% and 2.2% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The market expects to continue the process of normalization of monetary policy with further rate increases, by the FED, in the coming months. On the other hand, in the Euro Zone (ZE) economic activity would continue to expand around the potential, registering annual rates of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018. Inflation in this block of countries would remain below the target of 2.0% of the European Central Bank (ECB), reaching 1.6% and 1.4% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.","05","17",4
"For Latin America, the Consensus Forecast contemplates an exit from the recession in 2017, leaving Venezuela as the only country that would register a fall in its economic activity during the current year. The projections indicate that the region would expand by 1.6% this year and 2.6% by 2018, in the face of more favorable terms of trade. On the other hand, oil prices remain around US $ 50 per barrel, and current prospects do not contemplate significant fluctuations in the price of this mineral.","05","17",5
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity grew 5.2% in the first quarter of the year, gradually approaching its potential. Preliminary information of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) show a moderate growth in the month of April, due to the intense rains registered in some regions of the country, as well as for the purposes of statistical comparability given the high dynamism shown by the economy in April of 2016. Despite this moderation, a growth in the range of 5.0-5.5% is projected for this year, in line with that contemplated in the Monetary Program. Credit to the private sector in national currency increased at an annual rate of around 10.5% in May, consistent with the rate of expansion of economic activity in nominal terms.","05","17",6
"On the fiscal side, budget execution indicates a policy in line with the goals established in the government's financial plan. In that sense, as of April, government spending showed a decrease with respect to the level reached in the same period last year. This behavior, together with a significant improvement in revenues in May, points to the government meeting its deficit target of 2.3% of GDP for 2017, which implies a primary surplus of 0.8% of GDP. Regarding external accounts, foreign exchange generating activities, such as tourism and remittances, maintain a good performance, contributing to the strengthening of international reserves and facilitating the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate.","05","17",7
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. In that sense, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures against possible risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","05","17",8
"At its monetary policy meeting in May 2018, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% per annum.","05","18",1
"The decision to leave the reference rate unchanged was based on an exhaustive analysis of the risk balance for inflation, the main national macroeconomic indicators, the relevant international environment, market expectations and medium-term projections.","05","18",2
"Accumulated inflation during the first four months of the year was 0.95%, after observing in April a monthly variation of 0.40% in the consumer price index. In terms of twelve months, that is, from April 2018 to April 2017, the inflation rate stood at 4.05%, around the center of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program.","05","18",3
"Likewise, core inflation, linked to monetary conditions, was placed at 2.73% year-on-year. Forecasts indicate that inflation would remain within the target range in the two-year monetary policy horizon.","05","18",4
"In the international environment, the economic outlook continues to be characterized by the growth of world production. In that sense, Consensus Forecasts projects an expansion of the global economy of 3.3% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2019, under the leadership of the industrialized countries and some emerging economies. However, while the United States of America (USA) maintains a high economic dynamism, growth in the Euro Zone and in Japan tends to moderate.","05","18",5
"In this context, the markets anticipate that the process of rising interest rates in the US will continue, while maintaining an expansive monetary policy stance in the rest of the advanced economies. As a result of the macroeconomic behavior and the differences in monetary positions in the US and the ZE, a tendency of the dollar to appreciate in international markets is expected.","05","18",6
"This behavior of the US currency, together with upward pressure on the price of oil, could provoke a change in the monetary policy stance in some emerging economies through increases in their monetary policy interest rates.","05","18",7
"Under this scenario, according to Consensus, the US economy would grow 2.8% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019, while the economy of the Euro Zone would expand by 2.3% and 1.9%, during those years, respectively.","05","18",8
"On the other hand, in the emerging world, the BRICS economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) continue to grow, led by India, which is expanding at a rate higher than 7.0% so far this year and by China, which registered an increase in its real production of 6.8% in the first quarter.","05","18",9
"Brazil, the Latin American giant, would be growing 2.5% in 2018 and 2.9% in 2019. In the case of Latin America as a region, Consensus presents growth prospects of 2.7% for 2018 and 3.0% for 2019, excluding Venezuela that it would continue in recession.","05","18",10
"In the domestic context, economic activity continues to evolve favorably, as can be observed in the trajectory of the monthly indicator of economic activity (IMAE). In effect, the IMAE grew 7.5% in year-on-year terms in the month of April and 6.7% during the first four months of the year.","05","18",11
"At the same time, the trend-cycle component of the IMAE expands 6.6% in April, showing that the economy will continue to grow above its potential. This dynamism was the result, to a large extent, of the monetary stimulus provided last year by the reduction in the monetary policy rate and in the legal reserve.","05","18",12
"As a result of these measures, loans to the private sector in local currency continue to grow about 13% year-on-year to the month of May, while monetary aggregates present growth rates above nominal GDP expansion.","05","18",13
"On the fiscal sector side, income from collections has remained consistently above the budgeted amount during the five months of this year. If this trend continues, fiscal policy would achieve the deficit target of -2.2% of GDP, established in the 2018 Budget.","05","18",14
"In the external sector, the increase in oil prices is being compensated by a greater dynamism in foreign exchange generating activities, such as tourism, remittances, exports of goods and foreign direct investment, which contributes to the maintenance of the relative stability of the exchange rate and the strengthening of international reserves.","05","18",15
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy aimed at achieving the inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability. In this sense, it will continue to monitor the evolution of the world economy, as well as the main risks in the domestic context, in order to adopt the necessary measures in the face of possible effects on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","05","18",16
"BCRD keeps its monetary policy rate at 5.50% per year","05","19",1
"At its monetary policy meeting in May 2019, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.50% per annum.","05","19",2
"The decision to keep the benchmark rate unchanged is based on detailed analysis of the risk balance against inflation forecasts, including information from international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. April's monthly inflation was 0.53%, while cumulative inflation in the first four months of the year reached 1.39%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation stood at 1.61%, while underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, moderated to 2.07% in April. The BCRD forecasting system indicates that inflation would remain until the end of 2019 below the lower bound of the target range of 4.0% x 1.0%, converging at the centre of the target by 2020.","05","19",3
"The international environment has become more volatile, increasing uncertainty factors, including the escalation of trade disputes between major economies, the lack of agreement around the UK's exit from the European Union (Brexit) and the persistence of socio-political tensions in some emerging economies. Against this complex scenario, the growth outlook for the global economy has been revised downwards, estimated at 2.8% for 2019 and 2.9% by 2020, according to Consensus Forecasts.","05","19",4
"The performance of advanced economies continues to be driven by the United States of America,s.), although current indicators point to a potential slowdown for this economy in the medium term. Indeed, Consensus's projections indicate potential moderation in U.S. growth from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.6% in 2019 and 1.9% in 2020. Considering the prospects for a likely deterioration in economic activity, the Federal Reserve is expected to not make increases in its benchmark interest rate for the remainder of 2019, while the market expects at least a reduction in US interest rates by the end of this year.","05","19",5
"Also, in the face of slowing growth in the major euro zone economies (EES), growth prospects for this bloc remain low, with expansions estimated to be 1.1% in 2019 and 1.3% by 2020, according to Consensus. In view of this scenario, the European Central Bank has announced that it would maintain an expansive monetary policy stance at least until the end of 2019, while implementing a new liquidity provision programme to stimulate the private sector's lending pipeline through financial institutions.","05","19",6
"In Latin America, growth forecasts were revised downwards, with an expansion of 1.3% in 2019. It is important to note that the behavior within the region is heterogeneous. On the one hand, Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua would remain in recession, while the two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, are projected to grow below 1.5%. On the other hand, a group of economies would continue to grow with strong macroeconomic fundamentals, such as the Dominican Republic, Panama, Peru and Chile.","05","19",7
"In relation to raw materials, the price of oil has shown a downward trend recently, influenced by a moderation in global demand and concerns about trade tensions. Indeed, the price of Texas intermediate crude oil (WTI) fell below $55.0 a barrel at the end of May, below the level stipulated in the National Budget of $60.0 a barrel.","05","19",8
"In the domestic context, credit to the private sector has gradually slowed its pace of expansion, rising by 9.2% year-on-year at the end of May. In this sense, the recent action announced by the Monetary Board to release more than RD$29 billion of resources from the legal loophole, in an environment of low inflationary pressures, will contribute to boosting credit and growing the economy at the pace stipulated in the Monetary Programme of around 5.5%.","05","19",9
"With regard to fiscal policy, a balanced balance of the non-financial public sector is observed during the first months of the year, with a waiting for a primary surplus to be maintained during 2019, as envisaged in the National Budget. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as tourism, remittances and foreign direct investment perform well, contributing to relative exchange rate stability and facilitating greater accumulation of international reserves.","05","19",10
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic continues to monitor the moderation of the world economy and the uncertainty factors of the international environment, as well as its potential impact on the performance of domestic demand, being prepared to react in a timely manner to factors that may lead to deviations from the monetary agenda targets. ","05","19",11
"BCRD keeps its monetary policy rate at 3.50% per year","05","20",1
"At its monetary policy meeting in May 2020, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 3.50% per annum. In addition, the interest rate for the permanent ease of expansion (Repos to 1 day) remains at 4.50% per annum, while the interest rate on paid deposits (Overnight) stands at 2.50% per year.","05","20",2
"The decision on the benchmark rate is based on a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the current uncertainty on macroeconomic stability and future inflation developments. In this sense, April's monthly inflation was -0.82%, while cumulative inflation during the first four months of the year was -1.14%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from April 2019 to April 2020, was moderated to 1.07%, below the target range of 4.0% to 1.0%, while the underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, reached 2.75%. Moving forward, the BCRD forecasting system indicates that inflation would remain below the lower bound of the target range for the remainder of 2020. Low inflationary pressures give the BCRD greater degrees of freedom to continue reacting in a timely manner to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the Dominican economy, if necessary.","05","20",3
"In the international environment, high uncertainty prevails, even though, in those economies that have passed the most critical phases of the pandemic, containment measures that forced the cessation of productive activities and which have widened economic growth are beginning to be lifted. In this regard, Consensus Forecasts (CFC), which brings together leading analyst firms that make international projections, significantly reduced global growth projections from 2.5% in 2019 to -4.1% in 2020. In response to the weakening of global growth, central banks around the world continue to implement monetary easing and liquidity provision measures to support their countries' domestic demands.In the United States of America (USA), Consensus Forecasts projects that economic activity would contract this year, moving from an expansion of 2.3% in 2019 to -5.4% by 2020. Indeed, growth in the U.S. economy moderated to 0.2% year-on-year during the first quarter, while in April the unemployment rate stood at 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression of 1929. In addition, different indicators of consumption and industrial production suggest that the U.S. economy would show further deterioration in the second quarter of this year. In this context of low growth, higher unemployment and lack of inflation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has adopted a group of expansive measures, keeping at low levels its federal fund rate that is in the range of 0% - 0.25%, as well as the various quantitative easing programs injecting liquidity through Repos, purchases of public and private titles in the secondary market and credit channeling programs for micro small and medium-sized enterprises.","05","20",4
"As for the Euro Area, Consensus Forecasts projects that COVID-19 will cause an even greater contraction in this bloc of countries, ranging from 1.2% growth in 2019 to -7.9% by 2020. In response to this difficult outlook, the European Central Bank (ECB) keeps the short-term deposit rate (Overnight) at -0.50% per annum, while easing the terms of the private credit channelling programme through financial institutions and expanded the programme for the purchase of public and private securities on the secondary market.","05","20",5
"On the other hand, the high uncertainty caused by the pandemic has led to an increase in volatility in capital flows and affected the growth prospects of emerging economies, leading to a widespread depreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. In particular, Latin America, which was already facing a weakened economic situation, has been affected by falling commodity prices and a global tourism flow, causing a regional contraction of -5.9% by 2020. In this context, central banks in the region continue to implement liquidity provision and credit channeling programmes to the private sector in a widespread manner.","05","20",6
"In relation to raw materials, the price of Texas intermediate oil (WTI) has shown a partial recovery in May, influenced by the production cut agreed between countries belonging to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. Thus, the price of WTI was in May around US$30 a barrel, a level similar to the projection for the rest of the year. On the other hand, the price of gold remains high, around $1,700 per troy ounce, when it is used as a haven of value in a context of high uncertainty. The price dynamics of primary goods benefit the terms of trade for the Dominican Republic, which would partially offset, through lower oil bills and higher gold exports, the negative impact the pandemic has had on the external sector, particularly on tourism, remittances and exports as a result of the fall in the world economy.","05","20",7
"Importantly, at the time of coVID-19 containment measures in the Dominican Republic, the economy was in a favourable cyclical position, characterized by growth around potential and low inflationary pressures. These strong macroeconomic fundamentals have given the flexibility to take expansive monetary measures to accommodate the adverse shock. Indeed, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates that economic activity slowed significantly in March relative to the rate of expansion observed in January and February, thus recording a 0.0% year-on-year change in the first quarter of 2020.","05","20",8
"In this context, the Central Bank continues to implement a set of monetary and financial measures aimed at mitigating the effects of coronavirus through increased financing for productive sectors and households at lower interest rates. In particular, of the total RD$ 120 billion that have been made available to financial intermediation entities, some RD$ 64 billion have been channeled through different facilities, with some RD$56 billion being available to continue to support the productive activity and contribute to a rapid recovery in domestic demand during the rest of the year.","05","20",9
"It is emphasized that, even under current conditions of high uncertainty, the resources provided by the BCRD are being channelled at a faster rate than all previous occasions when these monetary policy instruments have been used. As a result, there has been a significant reduction of about 300 basis points in interest rates on loans granted by multiple banks since the adoption of the measures and a greater dynamism in monetary aggregates.","05","20",10
"In addition, favorable monetary conditions have contributed to an acceleration of credit to the private sector that expands at rates close to 14% year-on-year, highlighting the channelling of loans to the Manufacturing, Hotels and Restaurants, Trade and Construction sectors. The dynamism of private credit has increased access to working capital for sectors that have remained operating during the pandemic and provided greater liquidity to those activities that were suspended by confinement measures.","05","20",11
"On the other hand, it should be noted that the disbursement of some US$651 million as emergency financial assistance by the IMF, together with the measures to provide liquidity in foreign currency of about US$ 622 million and the interventions in the foreign exchange market that have been made during this year for some US$2.2 billion, will contribute to maintaining the relative stability of the exchange rate in the face of a convulsing international environment. In addition, the central bank's high levels of International Reserves, equivalent to approximately 10% of GDP, are highlighted, so the institution reiterates that it has sufficient resources and tools to continue to support the foreign exchange market, so that all foreign exchange needs of economic actors and the general public are met.","05","20",12
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In this regard, the institution will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Dominican economy, being prepared to continue reacting in a timely manner to factors that could jeopardize the inflation target and affect macroeconomic stability.","05","20",13
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monthly Monetary Policy Meeting of June 2012, decided to maintain its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (Overnight) at 6.0% per annum. At the same time, it decided to leave the Lombard Rate unchanged at 8.0% per annum.","06","12",1
"The decision not to vary the reference interest rate is based on the fact that the projections confirm that the inflation rate would continue around the lower limit of the target for the rest of the year. Indeed, in the month of May, the interannual inflation rate stood at 3.54%, below the target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for this year 2012. The interannual core inflation, which is related to monetary conditions, reached 3.67. %, while accumulated inflation in the January-May period stood at 0.68%. The forecast models do not foresee significant inflationary pressures in the monetary policy horizon.","06","12",2
"In the external context, in June, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States adjusted its growth forecast downward, from a range of 2.2% -2.8% to a range of 1.9% -2.4%, at the same time it foresees a lower inflation and higher unemployment. On the other hand, the Eurozone maintains a recession scenario with growth projections of -0.4% according to consensus. International financial markets show an increase in risk aversion due to uncertainty about the debt and fiscal crisis in some countries of the European Union, mainly Greece and Spain. International prices of primary goods continue to show a downward trend, although they remain high with respect to their historical averages.","06","12",3
"In the domestic sphere, the production and domestic demand indicators maintain a moderate trend and the projections indicate, in a passive scenario, that there would be idle production capacity so that the output gap would remain negative in the medium term. The growth forecasts for the end of the year point to a range of 4.0% -4.5%, in an environment of low inflationary pressures and relative stability of the exchange rate. Real interest rates remain positive which favors savings over consumption and investment spending, while the rate of growth of credit to the private sector has continued to moderate. The inflation expectations of the market are anchored around the goal, both for 2012 and for 2013.","06","12",4
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target of 5.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2012, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to react in a timely manner to risks on price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","06","12",5
"Organizational Matters By unanimous vote, Simon Potter was selected to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, effective June 30, 2012, on the understanding that his selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Secretary<U+0092>s note: Advice subsequently was received that the selection of Mr. Potter as Manager was satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By unanimous vote, the Committee selected James J. McAndrews to serve as Associate Economist, effective June 30, 2012, until the selection of his successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2013. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff to clarify some specific aspects of the policy.3 Discussion of Communications regarding Economic Projections Meeting participants discussed several possibilities for enhancing the clarity and transparency of the Committee<U+0092>s economic projections and their role in policy decisions and policy communications. In particular, participants noted that while the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) provides information about their individual projections of key macroeconomic variables and about the path of monetary policy that each sees as appropriate and consistent with his or her projections, the SEP does not provide guidance about how those 3 The policy is available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetary policy/files/FOMC_ExtCommunicationStaff.pdf . diverse views come together in the Committee<U+0092>s collective judgment about the outlook and appropriate policy as expressed in its postmeeting statement. Many participants indicated that if it were possible to construct a quantitative economic projection and associated path of appropriate policy that reflected the collective judgment of the Committee, such a projection could potentially be helpful in clarifying how the outlook and policy decisions are related. Participants discussed examples of the economic and policy projections published by a number of foreign central banks. Participants generally indicated a willingness to explore adjustments to the SEP, while highlighting the importance of communicating not only the Committee<U+0092>s collective judgment but also the diversity of their views regarding the economic outlook and monetary policy. Many participants noted that developing a quantitative forecast that reflects the Committee<U+0092>s collective judgment could be challenging, given the range of their views about the economy<U+0092>s structure and dynamics. Several participants judged that the incremental gains in transparency that would result from developing and presenting such a consensus projection would be modest, given the breadth of information already provided in the Committee<U+0092>s policy statements, the minutes of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, and the Chairman<U+0092>s press briefings. Participants agreed to continue to explore ways to increase clarity and transparency in the Committee<U+0092>s policy communications; many noted that the Committee had introduced a number of changes in its communications over the past year or so, and emphasized that further changes should be considered carefully. At the end of the discussion, the Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore the feasibility and workability of potential approaches to developing an FOMC consensus forecast. Developments in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s Balance Sheet The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the FOMC met on April 24<U+0096>25, 2012. He also reported on System open market operations, including the ongoing reinvestment into agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of principal payments received on SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency-guaranteed MBS as well as the operations related to the maturity extension program authorized at the September 20<U+0096>21, 2011, FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk<U+0092>s domestic transactions over _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System<U+0092>s account over the intermeeting period. By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to include the authority to conduct small-value operations for the purposes of routine testing of operational readiness. In addition, the Authorization was amended to include the authority to conduct intraday repurchase agreement (repo) transactions with foreign and international accounts to prevent daylight overdrafts in those accounts.4 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed at the June 19<U+0096>20 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a somewhat more modest pace than earlier in the year. Improvements in labor market conditions slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated. Consumer price inflation declined, primarily reflecting reductions in the prices of crude oil and gasoline, and measures of long-run inflation expectations continued to be stable. Private nonfarm employment rose at a slower pace in April and May than in the first quarter of the year, while total government employment continued to trend down. The unemployment rate stood at 8.2 percent in May, essentially the same as its average in the first quarter. The rate of long-duration unemployment remained very high, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed in recent months. Indicators of job openings and firms<U+0092> hiring plans were mixed, while initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period at a level consistent with modest net job gains in the coming months. Manufacturing production edged up, on net, in April and May after rising at a robust pace in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization remained about the same as earlier in the year. In recent months, the output of motor vehicles and parts increased further, on balance, although at a slower rate than in the first quarter, while factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector only inched up. Motor vehicle assemblies were scheduled to hold steady in the coming months, and broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the diffusion indexes of new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, 4 The authorization is available at www.federalreserve.gov/ monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_DomesticAuthorization.pdf . were generally at levels consistent with modest increases in output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures increased solidly in the first quarter. In April and May, however, nominal retail sales excluding purchases of motor vehicles declined while sales of motor vehicles slowed from their brisk pace in the first quarter. Factors that tend to support households<U+0092> expenditures were, on balance, a little softer in recent months. The estimated level of households<U+0092> real disposable income was revised down for the fourth quarter of last year. Moreover, real disposable income rose at a subdued pace in the first quarter of this year, though it received some boost from lower energy prices in April. Households<U+0092> net worth increased in the first quarter, but the decline in equity prices during the intermeeting period suggested that net worth may have fallen more recently. Consumer sentiment was lower in early June than earlier in the year, and it continued to be subdued. Activity in the housing sector generally improved in recent months, but it was still restrained by tight credit standards for mortgage loans and the substantial inventory of foreclosed and distressed properties. Both starts and permits of new single-family homes rose in April and May but remained at low levels. Although starts of new multifamily units ran at a somewhat lower pace, on average, in April and May than in the first quarter, permits increased in recent months, likely pointing to further gains in multifamily construction. Home prices rose for the fourth consecutive month in April. Sales of existing homes were a little higher in April than their monthly average in the first quarter, but the pace of new home sales was roughly unchanged. Real business expenditures on equipment and software increased moderately in the first quarter. In April, nominal shipments and orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased. Recent forwardlooking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions and capital spending plans, pointed toward continued moderate increases in outlays for business equipment in subsequent months. Nominal business spending for nonresidential construction was essentially flat in April relative to the first quarter. Meanwhile, inventories in most industries looked to be roughly aligned with sales in recent months. Real federal government purchases fell markedly in the first quarter, led by a sharp decrease in defense spending. Data for federal government spending in April and May pointed to a slower pace of decline in defense _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 19<U+0096>20, 2012 Page 3 outlays in the second quarter. Real state and local government purchases also decreased in the first quarter. Moreover, the payrolls of state and local governments contracted in April and May after edging up in the first quarter, and nominal construction spending by these governments continued to decline in April. The U.S. international trade deficit widened in March and then narrowed in April to a level near its average in the first quarter. Both imports and exports rose strongly in March before receding a bit in April. In particular, exports to the euro area, which had increased strongly in the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis despite the weakness in economic activity in the region, fell back in April. Overall U.S. consumer prices were flat in April and then fell in May as consumer energy prices declined considerably in both months. Survey data indicated that gasoline prices fell further in the first half of June, in line with continued decreases in crude oil prices. Meanwhile, consumer food prices only edged up in recent months. Consumer prices excluding food and energy increased moderately in April and May. Nearterm inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers declined in May and held steady in early June, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey remained stable. Measures of labor compensation indicated that increases in nominal wages continued to be subdued. Gains in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector were quite muted over the year ending in the first quarter, and with small gains in productivity, unit labor costs rose only slightly. The employment cost index increased only a little faster than the compensation per hour measure over the same period. More recently, average hourly earnings for all employees edged up in April and May, and their rate of increase from 12 months earlier continued to be slow. Recent indicators suggested that overall foreign economic activity was expanding at a below-trend pace in the second quarter. Euro-area economies appeared to be slowing: Industrial production declined in the euro area in April, and the composite purchasing managers index and indicators of business confidence fell in May to their lowest levels in more than two years. In China, data on production and sales in April and May suggested that economic activity was increasing at a less rapid pace than last year. In both advanced and emerging market economies, declining prices for energy and other commodities contributed to decreases in 12-month measures of inflation since late last year. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Growing concerns about developments in the euro area and weaker-than-expected economic data in the United States and abroad both weighed on financial markets since the time of the April FOMC meeting. The deterioration in investor sentiment was tempered to an extent by market participants<U+0092> expectations for further policy accommodation by central banks as well as by the anticipation of additional measures to address European fiscal and banking issues. Yields on longer-dated nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities moved down substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period. The yield on nominal 10-year Treasury securities reached a historically low level immediately following the release of the May employment report. A sizable portion of the decline in longer-term Treasury rates over the period appeared to reflect greater safe-haven demands by investors, along with some increase in market participants<U+0092> expectations of further Federal Reserve balance sheet actions. Indicators of inflation expectations derived from nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities also fell, apparently responding at least in part to the decline in commodity prices. The expected path for the federal funds rate derived from money market futures quotes shifted down in 2014 and beyond. There was limited evidence of increased strains in unsecured, short-term dollar funding markets over the intermeeting period despite heightened concerns about the situation in Europe. In secured funding markets, the overnight general collateral Treasury repo rate edged higher. Market participants attributed some portion of the firming in short-term rates over the past several months to a temporary increase in short-dated Treasury securities held by dealers as a result of cumulative net Treasury issuance of such securities and sales of these securities by the Federal Reserve under its maturity extension program. Broad U.S. stock price indexes declined, and optionimplied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose. Equity prices for large domestic banks significantly underperformed the broad indexes amid uncertainty about the situation in Europe and the outlook for the global economy. Disclosure of a large trading loss at a major U.S. bank also contributed to the underperformance. Investors<U+0092> expectation that five large U.S. banks would have their credit ratings downgraded at the end of June, as part of rating agencies<U+0092> review of major financial in- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee stitutions, may also have weighed on the equity prices of those banks. In the June 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), respondents reported that terms in a variety of dealer-intermediated markets were little changed over the past three months. Some respondents reported a decline in the use of leverage by hedge funds across various transaction types. Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate debt remained low by historical standards, but their spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened a bit. Nonfinancial firms continued to raise funds at a solid pace over the period, with the proceeds primarily used to refinance existing debt. Both commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding increased, on net, during April and May. New syndicated loan issuance also appeared to remain solid, although there were some reports of tighter terms. Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained strong in April and into May but then slowed after the poor performance of a prominent initial public offering. Financing conditions for the commercial real estate sector remained strained over the intermeeting period. Even so, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities in April and May outpaced issuance during the first quarter. Credit conditions in residential mortgage markets continued to be tight. Mortgage refinancing activity rose in April and May but remained subdued despite further declines in mortgage rates to historically low levels. Consumer credit expanded at a solid pace in recent months, as increases in student loans boosted nonrevolving credit while revolving credit was about flat. Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained low, partly reflecting a shift in the composition of borrowers toward those with higher credit scores. Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds picked up in April and May, with net issuance turning positive for the first time since the beginning of 2011. However, credit default swap spreads for state governments generally moved higher, and spreads on long-term general obligation municipal bonds over comparablematurity Treasury securities rose as well. Bank credit expanded in April and May. Banks<U+0092> holdings of securities continued to rise, and core loans<U+0097> C&I, real estate, and consumer loans<U+0097>also increased modestly. The May Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated that lending conditions again eased slightly, although perhaps less so for small businesses. M2 increased at a somewhat slower pace in April and May than in the first quarter of the year. The level of M2 and its largest component<U+0097>liquid deposits<U+0097> remained elevated, apparently reflecting investors<U+0092> continued desire to hold safe and liquid assets. Heightened financial strains in the euro area and indications of a weaker pace of global economic activity weighed on foreign financial markets during the intermeeting period. Yields on most euro-area peripheral countries<U+0092> sovereign debt rose, particularly after the May 6 elections in Greece failed to produce a new government. In addition, indicators of the conditions of European banks continued to deteriorate: Rating agencies downgraded major banks in Germany, Italy, Spain, and several other European countries; prices of euroarea bank stocks fell sharply; and credit default swap premiums for many euro-area banks increased. Pressures on Spanish banks led euro-area authorities to agree to provide official aid to the Spanish government for the purpose of recapitalizing the country<U+0092>s troubled banks. Indicators of funding market stresses remained muted, as many banks obtained funds from the European Central Bank (ECB) rather than interbank markets. The spreads of euro London interbank offered rates (or euro LIBOR) over comparable overnight index swap rates, along with implied basis spreads from euro<U+0096>dollar swaps, were little changed at short maturities, and the amount of dollar swaps outstanding with the ECB declined on balance. The total outstanding amount drawn on the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks dropped to $24.2 billion over the intermeeting period. Although equity prices in many countries rallied modestly late in the intermeeting period, global equity prices declined, on balance, over the period, with especially large net decreases in Japan and many emerging market economies. Flight-to-safety flows helped push yields on both U.K. and German 10-year sovereign debt to record lows before these rates partly retraced their declines. The staff<U+0092>s broad nominal dollar index ended the intermeeting period up moderately. Signs of a slowdown in global economic growth prompted policy easing by central banks in Brazil, China, and Australia, and the Bank of England announced new lending initiatives. The risks to the U.S. financial system emanating from strains in Europe appeared to increase over the intermeeting period. Although signs of strains in short-term _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 19<U+0096>20, 2012 Page 5 funding markets were muted, the reliance of some financial firms on these markets remained a potential vulnerability, given that investors could withdraw rapidly in a period of financial stress. Respondents to the June 2012 SCOOS reported that financial institutions and market participants had increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to central counterparties and other financial utilities. Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, the forecast for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near term was revised down. The revision reflected data indicating a slower pace of private-sector job gains, more-subdued retail sales, a lower trajectory for personal income, greater restraint in government purchases, and weaker net exports than the staff anticipated at the time of the previous projection. Moreover, recent adverse developments in Europe and tighter domestic financial conditions led the staff to revise down somewhat the medium-term forecast for real GDP growth. With the drag from fiscal policy anticipated to increase next year, the staff projected that the growth rate of real GDP would not materially exceed that of potential output until 2014 when economic activity was expected to accelerate gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy, further improvements in credit availability, and rising consumer and business sentiment. Increases in economic activity were anticipated to narrow the wide margin of slack in labor and product markets only slowly over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to still be elevated at the end of 2014. The staff<U+0092>s near-term projection for inflation was revised down from the forecast prepared for the April FOMC meeting, reflecting a greater-than-expected drop in consumer energy prices. However, the staff<U+0092>s projection for inflation over the medium term was essentially unchanged. With the upward pressure from the earlier run-up in crude oil prices on consumer energy prices unwinding and oil prices expected to decline further, long-run inflation expectations anticipated to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the forecast period, the staff continued to project that inflation would be subdued through 2014. Participants<U+0092> Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants<U+0097>the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC<U+0097>submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run, under each participant<U+0092>s judgment of appropriate monetary policy. The longerrun projections represent each participant<U+0092>s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants agreed that the information received since the Committee<U+0092>s previous meeting suggested that the economy had continued to expand moderately, though many noted that a variety of indicators showed smaller gains than had been anticipated. Growth in employment, in particular, appeared to have slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained elevated. Business fixed investment had continued to advance, and household spending appeared to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. There were further signs of improvement in the housing sector, but the level of activity remained very low. Volatility in financial markets increased over the intermeeting period, and investors<U+0092> appetite for riskier assets declined, likely in response to heightened fiscal and financial strains in Europe as well as some weakerthan-expected incoming data about the U.S. economy and foreign economies. Inflation had slowed somewhat, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months, and longerterm inflation expectations remained stable. Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually. Most participants saw the incoming information as indicating somewhat slower growth in total demand, output, and employment over coming quarters than they had projected in April, and most carried forward some of that downward revision to their projections of medium-term growth. However, some participants judged that the recent weakness in a variety of economic indicators was more likely to prove transitory, and thought that the outlook beyond this year was essentially unchanged. Reflecting the projected moderate pace of growth in production and em- _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee ployment, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would decline only slowly. A number of factors continued to be seen as likely to limit the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term; these included slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and<U+0097>despite some recent signs of improvement<U+0097>continued weakness in the housing sector. As in April, participants expected that most of the factors restraining economic expansion would ease over time, and so anticipated that the recovery eventually would gain strength. However, strains in global financial markets, which stemmed primarily from fiscal and banking concerns in Europe, had become more pronounced over the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook; the possibility of a sharper-thananticipated fiscal tightening in the United States also posed a downside risk. Looking beyond the temporary effects on inflation of this year<U+0092>s fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices, almost all participants continued to anticipate that inflation over the medium-term would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate. In one participant<U+0092>s judgment, appropriate monetary policy would lead to inflation modestly greater than 2 percent for a time in order to bring unemployment down somewhat faster. Some participants indicated that they saw persistent slack in resource utilization as posing downside risks to the outlook for inflation; a few participants judged that the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy posed upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook. In discussing the household sector, meeting participants noted that real personal consumption expenditures had continued to expand despite weak growth in real disposable income, but that the pace of expansion appeared to have slowed since earlier this year. A few participants expressed concern that slow growth in employment and low levels of consumer confidence would further restrain consumer spending. Many participants, however, said that business contacts had reported that consumer spending was holding up. Several observed that recent declines in gasoline prices would increase households<U+0092> real incomes and could boost consumer spending in coming quarters. More broadly, improving household balance sheets and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as likely to help support rising household expenditures over time. Indicators of home sales, construction, and prices suggested some improvement in the housing sector. However, not all regions shared in the gains, and the sector remained depressed overall. Most participants anticipated that housing markets were likely to recover only slowly over time, in part because tight credit standards in mortgage lending meant that low mortgage rates were now generating less of a pickup in home sales and construction than had been the case during the recoveries from earlier recessions. A few participants were more sanguine about the potential for a sizable upturn in housing activity. Still, with residential investment currently a much smaller share of real GDP than during past recoveries, the housing sector seemed unlikely to contribute substantially to a stronger economic recovery. Anecdotal evidence from business contacts indicated that activity in the energy and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months. Information from manufacturing and transportation firms was generally less optimistic than earlier in the year. There were a number of reports of slowing sales to Europe and Asia. Contacts in some parts of the country also indicated that firms had become more cautious in their hiring and investment decisions, with most capital investment being undertaken to improve productivity and reduce costs rather than to expand capacity. Some participants cited examples of business contacts saying that heightened uncertainty about future tax and regulatory policies had led them to put potential investment projects on hold until the uncertainty is resolved. Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters. They generally also saw the federal budget situation as a downside risk to the economic outlook: If an agreement was not reached to address the expiring tax cuts and scheduled spending reductions in current law, a sharp tightening of fiscal policy would occur at the start of 2013. A few participants reported hearing that defense contractors were making contingency plans to reduce their workforces if potential spending cuts go into effect; one reported that some firms already had begun to make such reductions. In contrast, it was noted that an agreement on a credible longer-term plan that put the federal budget on a sustainable path over the medium run in a way that removes the near-term fiscal risks to the recovery would help alleviate uncertainty, likely would have positive effects on consumer and business sentiment, and so could spur an increase in business investment and hiring. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 19<U+0096>20, 2012 Page 7 Exports helped support U.S. economic growth during the early months of this year. However, recent reports from some business contacts pointed to slowing exports to Europe and China, and several participants noted the risk that economic weakness in Europe or a more significant slowing in the pace of expansion in emerging markets in Asia could damp exports further. A couple of participants expressed the view that the direct effects on the U.S. economy stemming from slower economic growth abroad<U+0097>effects that would be manifested through declining U.S. exports<U+0097>would be noticeable but not large. However, another participant noted that recent appreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange markets would also contribute to reduced exports. The pace of improvement in labor market conditions diminished in recent months; in particular, growth in employment slowed. Job growth late last year and early this year was boosted by unusually mild winter weather; some slowing had been expected as weather became more normal during the spring, but the reported slowing was more substantial than many participants had anticipated. One participant noted that the apparent tension between strong employment growth and moderate output growth seen earlier in the year had been resolved more recently by slower job growth rather than faster output growth. Even so, average monthly growth in payrolls from January through May was in line with last year<U+0092>s pace. Meeting participants again discussed the extent of slack in labor markets. Some participants judged that the unemployment rate was being substantially boosted by structural factors such as mismatches between the skills of unemployed workers and those required for available jobs, a view that would imply less slack in labor markets than suggested by a simple comparison of the current unemployment rate to participants<U+0092> estimates of its longer-run normal level. A couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantial and persistent slack. One implication of the view that there is relatively little slack is that providing more monetary stimulus would be likely to raise inflation above the Committee<U+0092>s objective. Some other participants acknowledged that structural factors were contributing to unemployment, but said that, in their view, slack remained high and weak aggregate demand was the major reason that the unemployment rate was still elevated. These participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment: the still-high fraction of workers who report working part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work; research showing that job-finding rates among the long-term unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier; anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs; and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminating when filling vacant positions. Another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the United States have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level. These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation. Measures of consumer price inflation declined over the intermeeting period, mainly reflecting reductions in oil and gasoline prices since earlier in the year. Several participants noted that they saw little if any evidence of price pressures, commenting that increases in labor costs continued to be subdued and that non-energy commodity prices had declined of late. With longerrun inflation expectations well anchored and the unemployment rate elevated, almost all participants anticipated that inflation in coming quarters and over the medium run would be at or below the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges to be most consistent with its mandate; several had revised down their inflation forecasts. Most participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as being roughly balanced. Some participants, however, saw persistent slack in resource utilization as weighting the risks to the outlook for inflation to the downside. In contrast, a few saw inflation risks as tilted to the upside; they generally were skeptical of models that rely on economic slack to forecast inflation and were concerned that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run risked eroding the stability of inflation expectations, with a couple noting that large long-run fiscal imbalances also posed a risk. Many FOMC participants judged that overall financial conditions had become somewhat less supportive of growth in demand for goods and services. Investors<U+0092> concerns about the sovereign debt and banking situation in the euro area reportedly intensified during the intermeeting period, leading to higher risk spreads and _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee lower prices for riskier assets including equities and to broad-based appreciation of the U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets. In contrast, a few participants observed that the marked drop in yields on longer-term U.S. Treasury securities could provide some impetus to growth. Focusing more narrowly on the banking sector in the United States, it was noted that measures of credit quality for bank loans generally had continued to improve, that bank capital levels were quite high, and that banks had ample liquidity. Consumer and business loans were increasing, although credit standards remained tight and commercial and residential real estate lending were relatively weak. A few participants indicated that they were seeing signs that very low interest rates might be inducing some investors to take on imprudent risks in the search for higher nominal returns. Participants discussed the risk that strains in global financial markets and pressures on European financial institutions could worsen and spill over to parts of the domestic financial sector, and some noted the importance of undertaking adequate preparations to address such spillovers if they were to occur; it also was recognized that investor sentiment could improve and strains in global markets might ease. Several participants commented that it would be desirable to explore the possibility of developing new tools to promote moreaccommodative financial conditions and thereby support a stronger economic recovery. Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy had been expanding moderately. However, growth in employment had slowed in recent months, and almost all members saw the unemployment rate as still elevated relative to levels that they viewed as consistent with the Committee<U+0092>s mandate. Members generally expected growth to be moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually, with the unemployment rate declining only slowly. Most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in April. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets, which largely stemmed from the sovereign debt and banking situation in Europe, had increased during the intermeeting period and continued to pose significant downside risks to economic activity both here and abroad, making the outlook quite uncertain. The possibility that U.S. fiscal policy would be more contractionary than anticipated was also cited as a downside risk. Inflation had slowed, mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months. Averaging through its recent fluctuations, inflation appeared to be running near the Committee<U+0092>s 2 percent longer-run objective; with longerterm inflation expectations stable, members anticipated that inflation over the medium run would be at or below that rate. Some members judged that persistent slack in resource utilization posed downside risks to the outlook for inflation. In contrast, one member thought that maintaining the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy well into 2014 would pose upside risks to inflation. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to <U+00BC> percent in order to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the 2 percent rate that the Committee judges most consistent with its mandate. In addition, all members but one agreed that it would be appropriate to continue through the end of this year the Committee<U+0092>s program to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s holdings of securities; specifically, they agreed to continue purchasing Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace of about $44 billion per month while selling or redeeming an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less. These steps would increase the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s holdings of longer-term Treasury securities by about $267 billion while reducing its holdings of shorter-term Treasury securities by the same amount. Members also agreed to maintain the Committee<U+0092>s existing policy regarding the reinvestment of principal payments from Federal Reserve holdings of agency securities into agency MBS. Members generally judged that continuing the maturity extension program would put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. Some members noted the risk that continued purchases of longer-term Treasury securities could, at some point, lead to deterioration in the functioning of the Treasury securities market that could undermine the intended effects of the policy. However, members generally agreed that such risks seemed low at present, and were outweighed by the expected benefits of the action. Several members noted that the downward pressure on longer-term rates from continuing the Committee<U+0092>s maturity extension program was likely to be modest. One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Minutes of the Meeting of June 19<U+0096>20, 2012 Page 9 the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation. With respect to the statement to be released following the meeting, members agreed that only relatively small modifications to the first two paragraphs were needed to reflect the incoming economic data and the changes to the economic outlook. In light of their assessment of the economic situation, almost all members again agreed to indicate that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy and currently anticipates that economic conditions<U+0097> including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run<U+0097>are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. Some Committee members indicated that their policy judgment reflected in part their perception of significant downside risks to growth, especially since the Committee<U+0092>s ability to respond to weaker-than-expected economic conditions would be somewhat limited by the constraint imposed on monetary policy when the policy rate is at or near its effective lower bound. Members again noted that the forward guidance is conditional on economic developments and that the date given in the statement would be subject to revision should there be a significant change in the economic outlook. A few members expressed the view that further policy stimulus likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory growth in employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would be at the Committee<U+0092>s goal. Several others noted that additional policy action could be warranted if the economic recovery were to lose momentum, if the downside risks to the forecast became sufficiently pronounced, or if inflation seemed likely to run persistently below the Committee<U+0092>s longer-run objective. The Committee agreed that it was prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability. A few members observed that it would be helpful to have a better understanding of how large the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s asset purchases would have to be to cause a meaningful deterioration in securities market functioning, and of the potential costs of such deterioration for the economy as a whole. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: <U+0093>The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to <U+00BC> percent. The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it began in September to purchase, by the end of June 2012, Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of $400 billion, and to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less with a total face value of $400 billion. Following the conclusion of these purchases, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its current policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions should maintain the total face value of domestic securities at approximately $2.6 trillion. The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve<U+0092>s agency MBS transactions. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System<U+0092>s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee<U+0092>s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.<U+0094> The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 12:30 p.m.: <U+0093>Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately this year. However, growth in _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Business fixed investment has continued to advance. Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to <U+00BC> percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions<U+0097> including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run<U+0097>are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less. This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.<U+0094>","06","12",1
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, at its Monetary Policy Meeting of June 2013, decided to maintain its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (MPR) at 4.25%.

Core interannual inflation stood at 5.0%. Likewise, this base scenario is based on the premise that the Government would be closing the year as estimated in the 2013 Budget. For such purposes, and after having decreased 22% year-on-year in January-April, an increase is expected.

On the other hand, the recession continues in the Euro Zone, although in the case of Germany, the economic activity figures for May were more positive than expected by the market.

In May, the interannual inflation rate rose to 3.70%, remaining around the lower end of the target range for 2014 of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1%. The accumulated inflation in the five months computed of the year is 1.55%.

"Externally, the outlook for the world economy remains consistent with the recovery of the developed economies and a modest performance of the developing countries. However, in the face of extreme weather conditions, the United States of America (USA) revised its year-on-year first quarter growth again from 2.0% to 1.5%. This implies a growth of 2.2% for the current year, according to Consensus Forecast. One point to note is that the forecasts for 2015 and 2016 have not changed, so no changes are expected in the interest rate of the FED until next year.","06","14",3
"One of the reasons why policymakers in the US, mainly the Federal Reserve, foresee that there would be no interest rate increases in the rest of the year, is because of the labor market situation. For the current authorities of the FED, labor data is a relevant input in the decision making of monetary policy. Indicators such as the rate of hiring, resignation, duration of unemployment and hours worked show a marked improvement, which has led the FED to project unemployment rates closer to their pre-crisis levels, between 5.0% and 5.5% , for the next two years. The trend exhibited by the labor market is good news for emerging markets, since there would be no capital outflow in search of greater profitability abroad, decreasing the risks coming from international markets.","06","14",4
"On the other hand, the Euro Zone continues recovering with a growth close to 1.0%, but with a trend that presents risks of deflation. To moderate these risks and with the objective of expanding aggregate demand and employment in the region, the European Central Bank decided to implement new monetary stimulus measures at its meeting in June. In that sense, it reduced the monetary policy and deposit facility rates by 10 basis points, each, and the loan facility rate by 35 basis points. Additionally, and with the purpose of supporting credit to households and non-financial corporations, it decided to carry out new liquidity injection operations for approximately 400 billion euros. In the case of Latin America, the growth projections of the Consensus Forecast have also been revised down to 2.1%, due to the influence of negative growth rates in Venezuela and Argentina, and a moderate expansion in the region's largest economy. , Brazil.","06","14",5

According to the National Labor Force Survey of April, during the period October 2013-April 2014, 130,944 new net jobs were generated, surpassing the preliminary projections that were announced last March. With these results, the jobs created in the last 18 months, since October 2012, total about 200,745 new net employed. The creation of jobs has been reflected in a reduction of the open unemployment rate from 7.0% in October 2013 to 6.8% in April 2014.","06","14",6
"Likewise, credit to the private sector in national currency grew around 12.5% ??year-on-year at the end of June, above that foreseen in the Monetary Program. This rate of expansion in private loans in national currency would remain for the rest of the year. On the other hand, fiscal policy is executed in line with the provisions of the National Budget. In this sense, the Central Government practically reached a balance in its public finances in January-April, registering a small deficit of just 0.1% of GDP. The current account deficit continues showing a tendency to improve, influenced by the positive result of the first quarter of the year. This, together with a greater inflow of remittances and an increase in income from tourism, has enabled the Central Bank to revise its medium-term projection for this indicator downwards. The improvement of the current account anticipates low pressures in the exchange market in the coming quarters.

According to the BCRD's short-term liquidity management scheme, the rate of paid deposits (overnight) decreases from 4.00% to 3.50% per year and the rate of permanent ease of expansion (repos) is reduced from 7.00% to 6.50% per year.","06","19",2
"The decision to reduce the benchmark rate is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. May's monthly inflation was -0.03%, while cumulative inflation in the first five months of the year fell to 1.36%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from May 2018 to May 2019, fell to 1.31%, placing for the seventh consecutive month below the lower bound of the target range. Similarly, underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions by excluding prices of more volatile goods such as food and fuels, fell to 1.98% in May, while a downward revision in economic analyst inflation expectations for the entire monetary policy horizon was observed.

In this context, the Fed indicated that, in the face of increased uncertainty, it is prepared to implement expansive monetary measures to help sustain growth and avoid inflationary diversions, so market analysts expect a reduction in the benchmark interest rate at the next meeting in July.","06","19",5
"In addition, the growth outlook for the Euro Zone (ZE) remains low, with expansions of 1.1% in 2019 and 1.3% in 2020, according to Consensus.

"The decision on the benchmark rate is based on a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the current uncertainty on macroeconomic stability and future inflation developments. In this sense, May's monthly inflation was -0.11%, while the inflation accumulated during the first four months of the year was -1.25%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from May 2019 to May 2020, moderated to 0.99%, below the target range of 4.0% to 1.0%, while the underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, reached 3.10%. Moving forward, the BCRD's forecasting system notes that inflation would recover gradually, placing at the end of the year around the lower bound of the target range, which grants the BCRD degrees of freedom to maintain an expansive monetary policy stance aimed at mitigating COVID-19's adverse impact on the Dominican economy.","06","20",3
"High uncertainty prevails in the international environment, even though, in those economies that have passed the most critical phases of the pandemic, containment measures that forced the cessation of productive activities and which have widespreadly deteriorated economic activity have begun to be lifted. In this regard, Consensus Forecasts and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) significantly reduced global growth projections, estimating contractions of 4.7% and 4.9% in 2020, respectively. In response to the weakening of global growth, central banks around the world continue to implement monetary easing and liquidity provision measures to support their countries' domestic demands.","06","20",4
"In the United States of America (USA), the IMF projects that economic activity would contract this year, moving from an expansion of 2.3% in 2019 to -8.0% by 2020.

However, in recent months several indicators begin to show signs of a recovery, including the reduction in unemployment from 14.7% in April to 13.3% in May, as well as ups and turns off retail sales and consumption of durable goods. In this context of low growth and lack of inflation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has adopted a group of expansive monetary measures, with the federal funds rate expected to remain in the range of 0% - 0.25% until 2022. In addition, the Fed continues to implement various quantitative easing programs by injecting liquidity through Repos, purchases of public and private securities in the secondary market, and credit channeling programs for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.","06","20",5

In response to this difficult outlook, the European Central Bank (ECB) keeps the short-term deposit rate (Overnight) at -0.50% per annum, while easing the terms of the private credit channelling programme through financial institutions and expanded the programme for the purchase of public and private securities on the secondary market.","06","20",6
"On the other hand, the high uncertainty caused by the pandemic has led to an increase in volatility in capital flows and affected the growth prospects of emerging economies, leading to a widespread depreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. In particular, Latin America, already facing a weakened economic situation, has been affected by lower commodity prices and a global tourism flow, causing the IMF to project a regional contraction of -9.4% by 2020. In this context, central banks in the region continue to implement liquidity provision and credit channeling programmes to the private sector in a widespread manner.","06","20",7

"In relation to raw materials, the price of Texas intermediate oil (WTI) is gradually rising, influenced by the production cut of the Organization of petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) and its allies. Thus, projections indicate that the average WTI price for 2020 would be around $35 a barrel, below the value of about US$60 per barrel initially expected in the National Budget. On the other hand, the price of gold remains above $1,700 per troy ounce, being used as a haven of value in a context of high uncertainty. Commodity price performance benefits the terms of trade for the Dominican Republic, which would partially offset, through the oil bill and gold exports, the negative impact the pandemic has had on the activities of the external sector due to the contraction of the world economy.","06","20",9
"Importantly, at the time of coVID-19 containment measures in the Dominican Republic, the economy was in a favourable cyclical position, characterized by growth around potential and low inflationary pressures. These strong macroeconomic fundamentals have given the flexibility to take expansive monetary measures to accommodate the adverse shock. Indeed, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates that economic activity slowed significantly in March and April in relation to the pace of expansion observed in January and February, thus recording a cumulative average year-on-year variation of -7.5% in the first four months of 2020.","06","20",10
"In this context, the Central Bank continues to implement a set of monetary and financial measures aimed at mitigating the effects of coronavirus through increased financing for productive sectors and households at lower interest rates. In particular, of the total RD$ 120 billion that have been made available to financial intermediation entities (equivalent to a monetary stimulus of about 3 percentage points of GDP), some RD$ 80 billion have been channeled through different facilities, with an RD$ 40 billion being made available to continue to support productive activity and contribute to a rapid recovery in domestic demand during the rest of the year.","06","20",11
"As a result of monetary measures, there has been a significant reduction in interest rates on loans from multiple banks and greater dynamism in monetary aggregates.

"On the other hand, the pandemic has significantly affected public finances, due to a drop in tax revenues due to economic slowdowns and tax relief facilities, as well as increased public spending associated with social programmes aimed at preserving employment and implementing sanitative measures. In this regard, the Central Government deficit is projected to increase from -2.2% of GDP in the original budget to -5.0% of GDP, according to the updated estimates contained in the budget amendment approved by the National Congress.","06","20",13
"On the other hand, it should be emphasized that the measures to provide liquidity in foreign currency of some US$ 622 million and the interventions in the foreign exchange market that have taken place during this year have contributed to the lower currency flow associated with the paralysis of tourism, the reduction of remittances and the moderation of exports and foreign direct investment , in a context in which demand for dollars has increased markedly for precautionary reasons in the face of high uncertainty. In addition, it is emphasized that the high levels of International Reserves of the Central Bank will allow the institution to continue to support the foreign exchange market, in such a way that the foreign exchange needs of economic operators and the general public are met, helping to maintain the relative stability of the exchange rate in the face of a convulsive international environment.","06","20",14

At the same time, it decided to reduce the Lombard Tax Rate by 50 basis points, from 8.00% to 7.50% per annum.","07","12",1
"The decision regarding the reference interest rate is based on the fact that the projections confirm that the inflation rate would continue below the lower limit of the goal of 5.50% <U+00B1> 1.00% for this year 2012. Indeed, in In June, the interannual rate of inflation was 2.71% and the accumulated rate of January-June was 0.89%, while the interannual core inflation reached 3.36%.

"In the external context, the United States economy reflects lower than expected growth. In the case of the Eurozone, whose economy remains in a recessive state, recent announcements by the European Central Bank have been received with reserved optimism and fiscal risks remain high. In emerging economies, economic activity also shows a slight deceleration. Faced with reduced inflationary pressures, central banks, both in advanced countries and in emerging economies, have been compelled to apply expansive monetary policies. International prices of primary goods are lower than in 2011, except for some basic foods that have been affected by the drought in the United States.","07","12",3

"The decision to leave the reference rate unchanged is based on the analysis of the risk balance on the inflation projections. In this way, forecast models and market expectations indicate that inflation would be within the target in the monetary policy horizon. The inter-annual inflation rate, June 2012-June 2013, stood at 4.80%, accumulating 1.76% in the first six months of the year and influenced by a monthly variation of 0.04%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation stood at 5.10%.","07","13",2
"In the external context, faced with expectations of gradual de-escalation of the monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, international financial conditions have become more restrictive due to the reversal of capital flows, especially from emerging economies. In recent months, the US dollar has strengthened against most currencies worldwide. Particularly in Latin America, in the course of 2013, there have been depreciations of the exchange rate in countries such as Argentina (10.3%), Brazil (9.1%), Uruguay (9.1%), Peru (8.5%), Colombia (6.3%). ) and Chile (5.3%), higher than the one observed in the Dominican Republic of 3.9% so far this year.","07","13",3
"On the other hand, the Euro Zone remains in recession projecting a fall of 0.6% for 2013 while the growth projections for Latin America are located at 3.0%, according to the Consensus Forecast, consistent with the downward revision in prospects of growth of emerging economies. The prices of raw materials in world markets show a mixed picture, manifested in reductions in food and metals, and increases in fuels.","07","13",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand point to a moderate improvement for the second half of the year, influenced by the combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. Credit to the private sector in national currency accelerated in July, growing at an annual rate of around 13.5%, influenced by the placement of more than RD $ 12 billion of the resources released from the reserve requirement, more than 60% of the approved amount, as well as for the flexibilization of current regulations for debtors minors.

Likewise, the interannual core inflation, which is related to monetary conditions, was reduced to 3.32% at the end of June.","07","14",2
"Externally, growth projections for the world economy have been adjusted downwards for 2014, due to a combination of US economic performance below expectations and a reduction in the growth prospects of emerging countries, in an environment affected by climatic and geopolitical risks. In that sense, according to the Consensus Forecast, the economy of the United States of America points to an expansion rate of around 1.6% in 2014, despite the fact that it reported a growth rate estimated at 4.0% for the second quarter of the year. In that order, the downward adjustment in the growth prospects in 2014 is seen by the markets as temporary, since for 2015 the US economy is expected to grow around 3.0%.","07","14",3
"On the other hand, the Euro Zone continues the recovery process initiated last year. It is expected that by 2014 the economy of the Zone will increase by 1.1%, accelerating its growth to 1.6% by 2015. This trend of expansion observed in Europe significantly reduces the risks of deflation in the forecast horizon. In the case of Latin America, growth projections have been cut to 1.7% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2015, due to the influence of low growth exhibited by large economies such as Brazil and Mexico, while negative rates are expected in Venezuela and Argentina.","07","14",4
"In the domestic sphere, the positive economic dynamic is maintained, pointing towards a projected growth rate consistent with the Macroeconomic Framework for the end of the year, of 4.5%. In the same way, credit to the private sector in national currency grows above 13.0% year-on-year, higher than the nominal product projection for the end of the year. This rate of expansion in private loans in national currency would remain in the second half of the year. On the other hand, fiscal policy is carried out in line with the provisions of the General State Budget Law, while the behavior of the external sector continues to show improvement with respect to what was expected.

It was observed that the interannual rate of inflation in the month of June amounted to 0.62%. In cumulative terms, inflation stood at 0.60% at the end of that month. Likewise, core inflation, related to the monetary conditions of the economy, stood at 2.32% year-on-year in June. Forecasts continue to indicate that inflation would remain below the lower limit of the target established in the Monetary Program for 2015, converging to the center of the range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% in the monetary policy horizon.","07","15",2
"In the external environment, according to the Consensus Forecast, a year-on-year growth of the United States of America (USA) of 2.4% is expected for 2015 and 2.8% for 2016. Under this premise, it is expected that the US Federal Reserve will begin its normalization process monetary policy in the last quarter of the year and that inflation will gradually converge towards the goal by the end of 2016, after reaching the unemployment target of around 5.25%. In the case of the Euro Zone, the Consensus Forecast forecasts a product expansion of 1.5% for 2015 and 1.8% for 2016. Although there is still uncertainty regarding the outcome of the crisis situation in Greece, the effects on volatility in the markets of capital have tended to moderate. The projections for Latin America were revised downwards and suggest that the economy would not grow in 2015, increasing around 1.5% in 2016. However, this projection is highly influenced by the deteriorating situation of Venezuela's growth. If this country is excluded from the sample, Latin America would grow close to 0.7% in 2015 and 2.0% in 2016.","07","15",3
"In terms of raw material prices, the correction in the stock markets of China, the second largest economy in the world, has been reflected in significant reductions accompanied by a tendency for the dollar to appreciate worldwide.

"In the domestic sphere, internal production, demand and employment expand according to the expected trajectory. The cycle trend of the monthly indicator of economic activity (IMAE) at the end of May shows a year-on-year growth rate of around 6.1%, having revised the GDP growth of the first quarter of the year from 6.5% to 6.6%. Likewise, credit to the private sector in national currency grows at an annual rate of around 11.5% per month of July. On the fiscal policy side, public accounts continue to show a surplus as of May, indicating that by the end of this year a primary surplus would be created, in excess of the one established in the 2015 National Budget. The current level of public debt consolidated is around 46.0% of GDP, below the regional average. In the same way, the external accounts evolve favorably, projecting a current account deficit of the Balance of Payments around 2.0% of the GDP for the closing of the year. This trend would benefit the relative stability of the foreign exchange market, as well as the accumulation of international reserves that currently stand at around 3.4 months of imports.","07","15",5

The prices of oil and gold, important minerals for the Dominican economy, remain around US $ 45 per barrel and US $ 1,300 per troy ounce, respectively.","07","16",3
"On the other hand, the recent projections of the IMF World Economic Outlook, published last July, present prospects for lower economic growth worldwide, similar to the trend forecast by the World Bank in June. In effect, Consensus Forecast estimates that the United States of America (US) economy would expand by 1.9% in 2016, considering that Brexit would have an extremely small effect on that economy, while the Eurozone would grow 1.5% and Latin America would maintain the expectation of contraction in 0.5% in this year. For 2017, the US growth projection is 2.2% and for the Euro Zone an expansion of 1.3% is expected, according to Consensus Forecast. For the same year, the IMF presents growth projections of 2.5% for the US and 1.4% for the Euro Zone.","07","16",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand, observe a positive behavior in the short term to experience a growth above the potential level, together with a low and stable price variation. Credit to the private sector in national currency grows at an annual rate of 11.3% as of July. Total loans to the private sector, including financing in foreign currency, expanded around 13.6% during the same month, above the nominal product growth. In the fiscal sector, revenues grew at a rate of around 8.0% year-on-year, while spending showed a marked deceleration with respect to the previous months. It is expected that by the end of the year the budget deficit forecasts of approximately 2.3% of GDP will be met. Likewise, the projections of the external sector show that the current account deficit would close around 1.9% of GDP this year. If the current behavior of gold and oil prices continues, the current account deficit could be even lower. The evolution of the main macroeconomic variables supports the relative stability of the exchange market, while also facilitating the accumulation of international reserves.","07","16",5

According to the short-term liquidity management scheme of the BCRD, the rate corridor was adjusted in the same proportion, which indicates that the rate of short-term remunerated deposits (overnight) falls from 4.25% to 3.75% per year and the rate of expansion facilities (repos) is reduced from 7.25% to 6.75% per annum.","07","17",1

Likewise, the interannual core inflation, related to monetary conditions, was 2.18%. According to the most recent projections, inflation would approach the lower limit of the target range in the monetary policy horizon.","07","17",2
"Since last year, three external factors have conditioned the behavior of the Dominican economy: (1) the positive shock of supply, associated with international oil prices, which had benefited the Dominican economy in recent years, was reversed; (2) the Federal Reserve of the United States of America (USA) resumed the normalization process of its monetary policy; and (3) the uncertainty surrounding the economic policies of the new US government increased.","07","17",3
"However, since the last increase in the monetary policy rate in March, the international environment has changed. On the one hand, the increase in oil prices has moderated, reversing the upward trend shown by inflation in the Dominican Republic (DR). On the other hand, the process of normalization of the monetary policy of the United States has become more gradual and it is expected that the Federal Reserve would maintain an accommodative stance for the rest of the year. In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised down the growth prospects of the US, to 2.1% in 2017 and 2018, under the argument that there would be no fiscal impulse in the short term.","07","17",4
"Regarding the Euro Zone, the IMF projects a 1.9% growth in 2017 and 1.7% in 2018. On the other hand, Latin America would come out of recession, with the exception of Venezuela, registering moderate growth rates of 1.0% in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018.","07","17",5
"In the domestic sphere, preliminary figures during the second quarter of the year indicate that economic growth was significantly below its potential, influenced by a strong slowdown in private investment and a significant reduction in public spending, particularly in the spending of capital, which has contributed to the deficit of the Non-Financial Public Sector (SPNF) to be -0.5% of GDP in May. Additionally, monetary aggregates and total loans to the private sector moderated their expansion in the face of a reduction in both the demand for money and the demand for credit, associated with the influence of external and internal factors on the expectations of private agents.","07","17",6
"In this context, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reduced its legal reserve ratio by 2.2 percentage points, as a way to stimulate economic activity through credit in an environment of low inflationary pressures, since inflation is below the lower limit of the goal.

"The decision to increase the reference rate was based on an exhaustive analysis of the balance of risks around inflation projections, the main national macroeconomic indicators, the relevant international environment, market expectations and medium-term forecasts. During the first six months of the year, cumulative inflation was 1.43%, so the year-on-year inflation from June 2017 to June 2018 was 4.63%, above the midpoint of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program.","07","18",2
"Prior to the meeting, inflation forecasts in a passive scenario indicated a gradual upward trend, as a result of higher oil prices, domestic demand pressures and an increase in uncertainty in international financial markets, which evidenced the need of a change of position in the monetary policy that seeks the fulfillment of the goal in the horizon of policy of two years.","07","18",3
"In the external environment, a positive trend is observed, albeit with moderate growth in some advanced economies. Consensus Forecast projects a year-on-year increase in real world production of 3.3% in 2018 and 3.2% in 2019. The United States of America (USA) would continue to lead the industrialized countries with an economy that operates at full employment and that presents growth projections of 2.9% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019. It would be followed by the economy of the Euro Zone (ZE), whose real product would increase by 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively, during those years. As a result of the dynamism of the US and the rise in oil prices in the international market, inflationary pressures have increased in that country. To counteract them, the Federal Reserve (FED) has continued with its monetary normalization process increasing the policy rate by 50 basis points so far this year. The FED's rate adjustments would continue for the rest of 2018 and 2019.","07","18",4
"As the US advances in the normalization of its monetary policy, international financial conditions become less favorable, which has increased risk premiums and long-term interest rates for emerging economies. The higher interest rates in the US have also generated an appreciating trend in the dollar, which together with higher oil prices, has contributed to an increase in the depreciation of the currencies of developing countries.","07","18",5
"It is important to note that despite this environment of change in international financial conditions, the economic performance of emerging countries maintains a positive trend. India would be growing 7.3% in 2018 and 7.5% in 2019, while China would expand by 6.6% and 6.4% in those years, respectively. As far as Latin America (LA) is concerned, all economies, with the exception of Venezuela, would present positive growth this year. As a region, AL would expand 2.0% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019, according to the Consensus Forecast. It should be noted that this growth would occur despite the moderation observed in some large economies such as Argentina and Brazil.","07","18",6
"In the domestic context, economic activity continues to evolve favorably, as can be observed in the trajectory of the monthly indicator of economic activity (IMAE). In effect, according to preliminary data, the IMAE recorded an accumulated growth of 6.6% in the period January-May 2018. In this way, the IMAE trend-cycle expands at an annual rate of 6.9% in the month of May, projected that the economy would keep growing above its potential throughout the year. To the extent that this growth path is maintained and generates pressures on future domestic prices, monetary policy would continue to move towards the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus launched last year. In this way, important deviations in the differential between domestic interest rates and those of the US would be avoided, which if it could have an adverse macroeconomic impact.","07","18",7
"Consistent with this evolution of the economy, dynamism in the domestic financial market continues, reflected in an increase in credit to the private sector in national currency above the estimated expansion of nominal GDP. In that sense, as of July, private loans in local currency grew at a year-on-year rate of close to 13%, while monetary aggregates expanded above that contemplated in the Monetary Program.","07","18",8
"On the fiscal policy side, revenue so far this year has remained within the budgeted amounts at the same time that a moderate level of expenditure has been registered, which has allowed a fiscal surplus to be reached in the first five months of the year. This behavior of public finances would facilitate compliance with the deficit target, established in the National Budget. In the external sector, the dynamism registered in the foreign exchange generating activities has substantially contributed to moderate the impact of higher oil prices on the Dominican economy. Likewise, international reserves have remained at historically high levels, which contributes to the relative stability of the exchange market.","07","18",9
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target and maintain macroeconomic stability. In this sense, if necessary, the institution is prepared to continue normalizing its monetary policy in the following months, in line with the evolution of the world economy, as well as with the main domestic risks. In addition to promoting control of inflation and macroeconomic stability, monetary policy measures seek the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","07","18",10

"At its monetary policy meeting in July 2019, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to reduce its monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points again, from 5.00% to 4.75% per year. According to the BCRD's short-term liquidity management scheme, the rate of paid deposits (overnight) decreases from 3.50% to 3.25% per year and the rate of permanent ease of expansion (repos) is reduced from 6.50% to 6.25% per year.","07","19",2
"The benchmark decision is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. June's monthly inflation was -0.18%, so accumulated inflation in the first half of the year fell to 1.17%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from June 2018 to June 2019, stood at 0.92%, remaining for the eighth consecutive month below the lower bound of the target range. Similarly, underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, fell to 1.95% in June, while a downward revision in economic analysts' inflation expectations for the entire monetary policy horizon was observed. The different measurements would indicate the absence of inflationary pressures. The BCRD forecasting system notes that inflation would remain below the lower bound of the target range of 4.0% to 1.0% until the end of 2019, converging at the centre of the target by 2020.","07","19",3
"Various uncertainty factors persist in the international environment, associated with geopolitical risks and trade disputes between larger economies. In this context, global economic activity has slowed and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised downward global growth projections to 3.2% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2020, while Consensus Forecasts estimates global growth of 2.7% in both 2019 and 2020.","07","19",4
"The performance of developed countries remains led by the United States of America (USA), although there are signs of a slowdown in its economy, with year-on-year growth of 2.3% in the second quarter of the year. In this regard, Consensus estimates that the U.S. would grow 2.5% in 2019 and 1.9% by 2020. In this context of less dynamism and low inflationary pressures, the market expects the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate at its July meeting, while the Federal Reserve has indicated that it is prepared to implement expansive measures, if necessary to sustain economic growth and aggregate demand.","07","19",5
"In addition, the growth outlook in the Euro Zone (EEH) is revised downwards, with expansions estimated at 1.1% in 2019 and 1.2% in 2020, in the face of slowing down its larger economies and uncertainty around the UK's exit process from the European Union (Brexit). Considering this picture and low inflation levels, the European Central Bank highlighted the need to maintain a highly accommodative monetary stance and announced that they are assessing for their next monetary policy meeting to reduce their benchmark interest rate, along with a set of additional expansive measures, with the aim of increasing liquidity, boosting credit and reversing the deterioration in economic conditions in this bloc.","07","19",6
"On the other hand, growth projections continue to decline in Latin America, with a regional expansion of 0.9% in 2019 and 2.2% in 2020. This revision reflects lower forecasts for almost all Latin American countries, highlighting the two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, which would grow below 1.0% in 2019. In this less favourable outlook, the countries in the region that would see the largest expansion this year would be the Dominican Republic (5.5%), Panama (4.8%) Bolivia (4.0%), according to Consensus Forecasts.","07","19",7
"In terms of raw materials, the average price of Texas intermediate oil (WTI) remained in July at around US$57 per barrel, influenced by geopolitical conflicts between some crude oil-producing countries, which have been offset by lower demand associated with the slowdown in the global economy. In this regard, the average price is expected to be maintained during 2019 at around US$60 a barrel, consistent with what is envisaged in the National Budget. On the other hand, the price of gold has increased significantly in recent months, ranking above US$1,400 a troy ounce, being used as a value haven in a high volatility environment.","07","19",8
"In the domestic context, according to preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE), the economy expanded by 4.7% in the first half of the year, reflecting a slowdown in aggregate demand in recent months, associated with the persistence of uncertainty factors in the pre-election process and a complex international environment, which have affected investment expectations. In a context of low inflationary pressures, the package of expansive measures, including cuts in the monetary policy rate and the channelling of resources outstanding from legal lace, amounting to more than RD$21 billion, will continue to contribute to the dynamization of private credit and boost economic growth around the levels provided for in the Monetary Programme between 5.0% - 5.5%.","07","19",9
"On the other hand, the process of consolidation of public finances continues, with a primary surplus expected to be reached at the end of 2019, as stipulated in the National Budget.

In this regard, the institution will continue to monitor the moderation of the world economy and uncertainty factors, as well as its potential impact on the performance of domestic demand, being prepared to continue to react in a timely manner to factors that may lead to deviations from the macroeconomic goals of the Monetary Programme.

"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monetary Policy Meeting of August 2012, decided to reduce by 50 basis points its Monetary Policy Interest Rate (Overnight), from 5.50% to 5.00% per annum. At the same time, it decided to reduce the Lombard Tax Rate by 50 basis points, from 7.50% to 7.00% per annum.","08","12",1
"The decision regarding the reference interest rate takes into account that the inflation projections remain below the target, both for this year and for 2013. In July, the interannual rate of inflation was reduced to 1.64 %, while core interannual inflation stood at 3.16%. The forecast models do not foresee significant inflationary pressures in the two-year monetary policy horizon.","08","12",2
"In the external context, economic conditions remain similar to the previous month. According to the Economic Consensus, the United States would grow 2.2% in 2012, a slight improvement compared to the forecasts of the previous month, while the Euro Zone would experience a contraction of 0.5% this year, with sharp decreases in Greece (6.7%), Spain (1.7%) and Italy (2.1%). In Asia, the Chinese economy has shown signs of slowdown, reaching a growth of 7.6% in the second quarter. The forecasts for Latin America have also been revised downwards, with the region's growth estimated for 2012 at 2.9% as a result of a strong deceleration of its larger economies, with Brazil and Argentina standing out. International prices of primary goods remain relatively stable, although they are still above their historical averages.","08","12",3
"In the domestic sphere, the indicators of production and domestic demand remain below their long-term trend. The Dominican economy grew 3.8% in the first half of the year and it is expected that in 2012 it would reach a growth of around 4.0%. As a result of the latest monetary policy decisions, the interest rates of the Financial System have been decreasing. This contributes to creating the conditions for a possible revitalization of credit to the private sector, which had reduced its annual growth rate in response to the expectations originated by the electoral cycle.","08","12",4
"It should be noted that the process of revitalizing credit could be conditioned by expectations about future economic policy decisions and their impact on the decisions of consumption and investment of economic agents. However, the Central Bank estimates that the greater channeling of resources for productive activities as a consequence of the expansionary stance of monetary policy, would boost the economy in the short term, smoothing the effects of a possible process of fiscal consolidation.","08","12",5

"At its monetary policy meeting in August 2013, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to increase its Monetary Policy Rate by 200 basis points, from 4.25% per annum to 6.25% per annum. At the same time, the interest rates of permanent expansion and monetary contraction facilities will increase to 7.75% and 4.75% annually, respectively.","08","13",1
"The decision to raise the reference rate takes into account the balance of risks on inflation projections, particularly the potential transfer to domestic prices that could occur, as a result of the volatility experienced by the foreign exchange market in recent weeks. The inter-annual inflation rate, July 2012-July 2013, stood at 5.67%, accumulating 2.39% in the first seven months of the year, while the monthly variation reached 0.62%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation stood at 5.25%.","08","13",2
"In the external context, given the lower expectations of global economic growth and the possible gradual dismantling of the monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, international financial conditions have become more restrictive. International capital flows are emerging from emerging economies, producing an almost generalized depreciation in the currencies of these countries. The Euro Zone continues in recession despite the fact that the latest growth data shows a possible turning point. In Latin America, Consensus Forecast growth projections were revised down in August, while capital outflows continue to weaken local currencies. International prices of raw materials, particularly oil, show an upward trend that has accelerated due to geopolitical risks.","08","13",3
"In the domestic sphere, the growth of economic activity and domestic demand reached a turning point in the first quarter of the year. After the sharp slowdown in January-March, the economy grew 2.8% in the April-June period. Credit to the private sector in national currency accelerated its year-on-year growth rate to exceed 14.0% in August, as a result of the process of transmission of monetary policy towards economic activity. It is expected that the economy will continue presenting an upward trend in the coming months in a context of recovery of the confidence of the private sector and of an ordered behavior of public finances, in line with the Budget. It is expected that in the second half of the year the process of fiscal consolidation would continue, allowing the Government to reduce the public deficit to 1.1% of GDP for the year in January-June, below the deficit of 1.4% of GDP, consistent with the Budget.","08","13",4

"Externally, the most recent information confirms that the economic conditions of the United States continue to improve. The US economy recorded a revised growth of 4.2% in the second quarter of the year, better than expected, pointing to an expansion rate of around 2.1% in 2014. The outlook for the Eurozone shows signs of weakening as it grows 0.3 % in the second quarter. Even though it is estimated that the Euro Zone would reach positive growth this year, some of its most important economies, such as France and Italy, continue to decelerate. In the case of Latin America, growth projections have been revised downward, standing at 1.4% for 2014 and 2.4% for 2015, due to the influence of negative growth exhibited by large economies such as Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina.","08","14",3
"In the domestic sphere, the national accounts referenced to the year 2007, recently published, show a growth of the Dominican economy of 7.2% in the first half of 2014. Thus, the growth projection points to a rate higher than the estimated 5% in the Macroeconomic Framework for 2014. In addition, market interest rates have been reduced significantly, contributing to a greater growth of credit to the private sector in national currency, above 14.0% year-on-year. On the other hand, the fiscal policy is executed resulting in a lower deficit than that foreseen in the Budget, due to the fact that revenues grow above the budgeted, together with the moderation of the growth of public spending. On the other hand, the performance of the external sector continues to improve, projecting a deficit of around 4% of GDP by the end of the year. This trend would contribute to maintaining the relative stability of the exchange rate.","08","14",4

It was observed that the interannual rate of inflation rose to 0.50% in the month of July. In cumulative terms, inflation stood at 0.85% during the first seven months of the year. Likewise, core inflation, an indicator that reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, was 2.11% year-on-year. Forecasts continue to indicate that inflation would remain below the lower limit of the target set in the Monetary Program for 2015, gradually converging towards the center of the range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% for 2016.","08","15",2

Recent figures show that the United States of America (USA) grew 2.7% year-on-year during the second quarter of the year, while the Euro Zone expanded by 1.2% year-on-year in the same period. Both in the United States and in the Euro Zone, inflation remains low, standing at 0.2% year-on-year for the end of July, as a result of the downward trend shown by the prices of commodities in global markets. According to the latest forecasts of the Consensus Forecast (CFC), the EUA would grow around 2.3% and 2.7% in 2016. For CFC, the Eurozone would close this year with an expansion of 1.5% and achieve a rebound to 1.8% for 2016.","08","15",3
"In addition to the behavior of commodities in international markets, other forces have been influencing the behavior of the global economy recently. On the one hand, the dollar has presented an appreciating trend over the last year, strengthening against other currencies such as the euro, the Japanese yen and the pound sterling. On the other hand, the markets have shown some concern with the lower growth observed in China to the point that, recently, the stock exchanges of the main world financial centers recorded a significant decline. With the aim of relaunching its growth, China reduced its monetary policy rate for the fourth time this year, while devaluing its currency, the Yuan, to boost exports. At the Central Bank, we are closely monitoring these events, although we understand that the short-term direct effects on our economy would be minimal.","08","15",4
"With respect to Latin America, growth continues to decline, as a result of the slowdown in economic activity in some of the largest economies, particularly Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In the particular case of Brazil, the recession deepens after a 2.6% drop in the second quarter of the year. For Latin America as a region, Consensus Forecast estimates a contraction of 0.2% in 2015, recovering gradually in 2016 until reaching an expansion of 1.2% at the end of that year.","08","15",5
"In the domestic environment, economic activity continues to show high dynamism. The cycle trend of the monthly indicator of economic activity (IMAE) shows a year-on-year growth rate of 6.4% in June, while private loans grew above 11.0% in July. In the fiscal context, the government continues with the process of fiscal consolidation initiated three years ago. Preliminary figures show that the operations of the Central Government recorded a surplus during the first semester of the year, which allows us to foresee that by the end of the year the target established in the National Budget would be met. Likewise, the conditions of the external sector remain favorable when registering a small surplus during the first six months of the year, as a result of the decrease in oil prices and the strengthening of tourism, remittances and the activity of free zones. Positive records in fiscal and external accounts for the first half of the year indicate that the fundamentals of the Dominican economy remain strong, facilitating the relative stability of the exchange rate and the accumulation of reserves.","08","15",6

In the financial sector, credit to the private sector in national currency grew above 11.5% year-on-year, higher than the nominal product projection for the end of the year.","08","16",7
"In the fiscal area, there is a moderation in spending in the second half of the year in line with the deficit target established in the Budget Law.

"In the domestic context, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates that economic growth has begun to recover, reaching 4.7% in the January-July period and, if this trend continues, would be around its potential by the end of the year. Domestic economic activity has been influenced by a complex international environment, as well as by the uncertainty characteristic of pre-election processes and their impact on expectations. However, expansionary monetary measures have begun to boost private credit, through the channeling of more than RD$17 billion of legal lace resources as financing to the productive sectors. In this regard, monetary policy interest rate cuts and the disbursement of resources outstanding from the legal loophole, amounting to almost RD$17.3 billion, are expected to boost domestic demand in the coming months, through increased investment and private consumption.","08","19",9
"On the other hand, the process of consolidation of public finances is maintained, with a primary surplus expected to be reached at the end of 2019, as stipulated in the National Budget. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as foreign direct investment and remittances have performed well, compensating for the recent moderation of tourism, induced by lower global demand and by the negative media campaign in the face of isolated cases in the sector. In this challenging international environment, the Dominican Republic has maintained the relative stability of the exchange rate, presenting a cumulative depreciation in the year of 2.0%, lower than that observed in the same period of the previous year and among the lowest among Latin American countries and emerging economies, as a result of the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and credibility in its economic policies.","08","19",10

"The decision regarding the reference rate takes into account the inflation projections that indicate that there are no significant deviations from the goals established in the Monetary Program, both for 2013 (5.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%) and for 2014 (4.5% <U+00B1> 1.0%). In August, the interannual inflation rate stood at 5.30%, accumulating 3.07% in the first eight months of this year. On a monthly basis, inflation reached 0.66% in August. In addition, core inflation, which is the price indicator that best reflects monetary conditions, decreased in interannual terms from 5.25% in July to 4.70% in August, below the central value of the target range for 2013.","09","13",2
"In the external context, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States of America maintained its policy of quantitative easing without change, which caused a decrease in the market interest rates in that economy, as well as the reversal of the flows of capital from emerging economies and the appreciation of the dollar. Indicators of expectations of the private sector in the Euro Zone show a perception that the economy of that bloc of countries could be emerging from recession in the coming months, driven by the growth of the largest economies such as Germany and France. In Latin America, according to the latest Consensus Forecast report, a 2.6% growth is projected for the current year, which implies a moderation compared to the average of recent years. Regarding international prices, a more stable behavior is observed in raw materials, although they still remain above their historical averages. In the domestic sphere, economic activity shows signs of improvement. Preliminary figures of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity point to a growth trend, consistent with the projection of 3.0% of the Monetary Program. An important determinant of this behavior is the evolution of credit to the private sector in national currency, which has presented year-on-year growth of around 14.5% in the month of September and is expected to close the year close to 12.0%. In the fiscal sector, the government maintains a public investment program in line with its budget plan, while carrying out an expenditure policy consistent with meeting its deficit target of 2.8% of GDP, for the closing of the year.","09","13",3
"The decision to liberalize some RD $ 20,000 million of the legal reserve to the productive sectors has contributed notably to the dynamism of credit. In May-September, almost 80% of the amount to be liberalized had been placed (some RD $ 15.5 billion of the reserve), which has generated a multiplier effect in the financial system, reaching the total increase of private credit in national currency, more than RD $ 30,000 million, during that period. So far this year, since last December, private credit in national currency has grown around RD $ 38,000 million, a significant recovery compared to the same period last year, when there was a fall of approximately RD $ 5 billion. In interannual terms, September 2012-September 2013, private credit in national currency has expanded by RD $ 58,000 million, amount 4.3 times greater than the total placed a year before, between September 2011 and September 2012.","09","13",4
"The liquidity of the financial system continues to grow according to the provisions of the Monetary Program.

"The decision regarding the reference rate took into account the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as the performance of the main macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. Last August, the year-on-year rate of inflation fell to 3.13%, below the lower end of the target range of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2014. Accumulated inflation in the first eight months of the year is 2.33%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation, an indicator that collects information on the movement of prices of monetary origin, was reduced to 3.26%.","09","14",2
"In the external context, the growth of the United States of America (USA) was revised upwards to 4.6% during the second quarter of the year. The Federal Reserve Bank continues to implement its gradual policy of moderation of monetary stimulus, implemented during the international financial crisis. The latest forecasts of the Consensus Forecast suggest that the US would grow 2.1% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015. This indicates that the recovery of the US economy would continue gradually, with no anticipated increases in interest rates until at least the middle of next year. In the case of the Eurozone, although the economy showed signs of weakening in its economic activity during the second quarter of the year, positive growth is expected around 0.9% for the end of 2014 and 1.4% for 2015, consolidating its process of Economic recovery. Regarding Latin America, the Consensus Forecast revised its economic growth projection to 1.4% for this year, as a result of signs of recession in some of the large economies such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.","09","14",3
"In the domestic sphere, the accumulated economic growth as of August amounted to 6.9%, according to the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE). For 2015, the macroeconomic framework contemplates a growth of 5.0%, around the potential product. Market interest rates remain below their historical average, while credit to the private sector in national currency expands at a year-on-year rate of 14.9%. On the fiscal policy side, budget execution points to a smaller deficit than expected in 2014, because revenues grow at an annual rate higher than that of public spending. The Government's strategy to reduce the fiscal deficit would continue in 2015, as a way to make public finances more sustainable. Regarding the external sector, a current account deficit of around 3.9% of GDP is projected for the current year. The moderation in the current account deficit has contributed to the fact that the depreciation of the exchange rate, so far this year, is only 2.4%. It is expected that next year the greater dynamism observed in the sectors that generate foreign exchange will continue, which would help maintain relative stability in the exchange market.","09","14",4
"The Central Bank confirms its commitment to implement monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target and affirms that, if necessary, it can assume a different policy stance as the world economy evolves and the domestic situation in the face of potential risks that affect stability. of prices, growth and good functioning of the financial and payment systems.","09","14",5

It was observed that in the month of August the interannual rate of inflation fell to 0.43%; in cumulative terms, inflation stood at 1.17% in the eighth month of the year. In the same way, core inflation, an indicator that reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, fell to 1.99% year-on-year. Forecasts continue to indicate that inflation would remain below the lower limit of the target set in the Monetary Program for 2015, gradually converging towards the center of the range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% for 2016.","09","15",2
"In the external environment, the behavior of the international economy continues to be determined by the improved performance of the industrialized countries, while the large emerging market economies are affected by the cycle of falling commodity prices. The gradual deceleration of the Chinese economy and the weakness of large emerging economies such as Russia and Brazil, induce the risks of global economic growth downward. Taking this into consideration, the Federal Reserve Bank left its monetary policy rate unchanged at last September's meeting, despite the notable expansion of production in the United States of America (USA). In the international exchange markets, the tendency to the appreciation of the dollar is maintained, while oil prices continue below the average of recent years. This behavior of international markets has reduced inflation in the United States and Europe, in contrast to what happened in the countries of Latin America that export raw materials, where exchange rate depreciation has generated higher inflation.","09","15",3
"According to Consensus Forecast, the US economy would grow 2.5% in 2015, while the Eurozone would expand by 1.4% in the same period. Both in the United States and in the Euro Zone, inflation would remain low, standing at around 0.2% at the end of the year. In 2016, growth in the United States would increase to 2.7%, while in the Euro Zone it would be 1.7%. In the case of Latin America, consensus projects a contraction of 0.6% in 2015, recovering gradually in 2016 until reaching an expansion of 0.8% at the end of that year. This scenario would be determined by the projected contraction of the economies of Brazil (-2.6%) and Venezuela (-7.4%), as well as the low growth in Argentina (0.7%) and the slowdown in the growth of other major commodities exporters, such as this is the case of Chile (2.2%) and Peru (2.8%).","09","15",4
"In the domestic sphere, Dominican economic activity continues to show a high dynamism in the short term, as a result of the notable improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals. In that sense, the cycle trend of the monthly indicator of economic activity (IMAE) presents a year-on-year growth rate of 6.2% in July, while loans to the private sector grew around 10.7% in the month of September. In the context of fiscal policy, the government has proposed a budget for 2016 in which the process of fiscal consolidation initiated three years ago is maintained by contemplating a primary surplus of around 0.7% of GDP and a deficit for the year equivalent to 2.3% of GDP. Likewise, the external sector presents a tendency to balance in the current account balance thanks to the drop in oil prices and the better performance of tourism, remittances and free zones. These positive results in the fiscal and external accounts, would facilitate the accumulation of reserves and the relative stability of the exchange market.","09","15",5

"In the external context, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States of America (FED) decided to maintain its TPM at its September meeting without change. However, within the FED, the arguments in favor of an increase in rates this year have been strengthened, indicating that the normalization of monetary policy could be resumed in the coming months. According to the Consensus Forecast's vision of the industrialized economies, the United States would be growing 1.5% in 2016, showing greater dynamism in 2017 with an expansion of the product around 2.3% year-on-year. The Euro Zone (ZE), on the other hand, would expand at interannual rates of around 1.5% in 2016, driven by the growth of economies such as Germany (1.8%) and Spain (3.0%). For 2017, incorporating the impact of Brexit on the economies of the region, the growth of the EZ would moderate to 1.3% year-on-year.","09","16",3
"In Latin America, Consensus Forecast corrected its growth projections for the current year from -0.5% year-on-year in August to -0.3% year-to-year in September. Despite this small improvement in projections, at least four major economies in the region would remain in recession: Venezuela (-10.1%); Brazil (-3.2%); Ecuador (-2.3%); and Argentina (-1.5%). An important recovery of Latin America is expected in 2017 with a growth of around 2.2%, leaving only the Venezuelan economy in recession (-2.6%). The large countries of the region would benefit from a moderate increase in commodity prices next year, while the smaller economies, such as those of Central America and the Caribbean, would face more favorable conditions for their exports, given the greater dynamism of United States, its main commercial partner.","09","16",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand are evolving positively. In January-August, the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) shows real growth around 6.8% year-on-year, which indicates that the economy would be growing this year above its potential. Credit to the private sector in national currency shows a year-on-year growth rate of around 12.6% in September and continues to grow above the nominal product expansion. In the fiscal sector, public spending has slowed down in the second half of the year and it is expected, according to the most recent budget update, that at the end of 2016 the deficit will approach 2.7% of GDP and for 2017 it stood at 2.3% of GDP. On the side of external sector accounts, the current account deficit would end 2016 with a deficit of around 1.7% of GDP. Under this scenario, conditions are favorable for accumulating international reserves and maintaining the relative stability of the foreign exchange market.","09","16",5

"In the external context, the advanced economies experience an acceleration in their growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. The outlook is favorable for the United States of America (USA), the Euro Zone (ZE) and Japan. According to the Consensus Forecast, the US would grow 2.2% in 2017, after the annualized interquarterly growth of April-June, which reached 3.1%, was revised upwards. By 2018, the US is projected to grow 2.4%, in a context of normalization of monetary policy. As for the EZ, it is projected that the product would expand by 2.1% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2018. The dynamism of the advanced economies would have a positive impact on world economic activity, which would grow 3.0% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018. It should be noted that the inflationary pressures of the developed economies remain relatively low, projecting 2.0% for the US in 2017 and 1.9% in 2018, as well as inflation rates of 1.5% in 2017 and 1.3% in 2018 for the ZE.","09","17",3

On the other hand, Mexico would expand 2.2% in both years, while Chile would grow 1.4% in 2017 and 2.9% in 2018 The projections for Latin America have been revised upwards and reflect that the economy of the region would expand 1.7% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018, driven by more favorable terms of trade.","09","17",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity reacted favorably after the expansionary measures taken at the end of July, such as the reduction of the monetary policy rate by 50 basis points and the reduction in the legal reserve by 2.2 percentage points. It should be noted that credit to the private sector in national currency has increased by RD $ 16,000 million since these measures were taken, so that positive prospects remain for the revitalization of domestic demand for the rest of 2017. In that sense, Growth is expected to approach its potential by the end of the year, even in a context of recovery from the damage caused by recent climate events. It is important to note that the World Bank approved a loan of US $ 150 million for the Dominican Republic with the purpose of facing natural disasters, which would facilitate the reactivation of economic activity during the last quarter of the year.","09","17",5
"In the fiscal sector, a boost to public spending was recently announced, implying a more active fiscal policy for the rest of the year. Notwithstanding this decision, the Government announced that it would meet the deficit target of 2.3% of GDP, established in the National Budget for 2017. On the other hand, the external sector maintains its dynamism, contributing to the increase of foreign exchange earnings and creating a favorable environment for the relative stability of the foreign exchange market and for the accumulation of international reserves.","09","17",6

In recent months, inflationary pressures have moderated. In that sense, the cumulative inflation to the month of August stood at 1.44%, which is why inter-annual inflation fell from 4.43% in the month of July to 3.87% in August, below the central value of the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program. Core inflation, linked to monetary conditions, fell to 2.59% year-on-year in August.

"In the external context, the growth prospects of the world economy continue at around 3.3% during 2018 and 3.1% in 2019. According to Consensus Forecast, the United States of America (USA) would grow 2.9% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019. Given the dynamics of expansion and full employment of that economy, the monetary policy in the US continues with the process of normalization, gradually withdrawing the monetary stimulus in force since the global financial crisis. Under these conditions, market interest rates tend to rise and the US dollar appreciates.","09","18",3
"On the other hand, the economy of the set of countries that make up the Euro Zone (ZE) would grow 2.1% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, while Japan would expand by 1.1% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2019, according to the Consensus Forecast.

According to the Central Bank forecasting system, economic activity maintains its dynamism with year-on-year growth in 2018 in the range of 6.0% - 6.5%, while inflation would be around the lower limit of the target at the end of this year . For the next year, economic growth is projected to converge to its potential and inflation to approach the center of the target.","09","18",8
"On the fiscal policy side, a moderation in public spending, together with tax revenues in line with the budget, has led to a deficit of the Non-Financial Public Sector of just 0.2% of GDP as of July. In the external sector, the momentum of foreign currency generating activities has substantially contributed to moderate the impact of higher oil prices on the Dominican economy and international reserves maintain levels equivalent to more than four months of imports, which favors stability relative of the exchange market.","09","18",9

August's monthly inflation was 0.47%, while cumulative inflation in the first eight months of the year stood at 1.99%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from August 2018 to August 2019, stood at 1.72%, remaining below the lower bound of the target range. In addition, underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.04% in August. Inflation expectations from economic analysts, as well as the BCRD's forecasting system, indicate that inflation would be at the end of 2019 around the lower bound of the target range of 4.0% to 1.0% and would remain close to the centre of the target range by 2020.","09","19",3

"The U.S. growth outlook stands at 2.3% for 2019 according to Consensus Forecasts, moderating to 1.8% by 2020. Taking into account the lower dynamism of economic activity and low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve decreased in September, for the second consecutive time, its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, consistent with what is expected by market analysts. In addition, the Federal Reserve has been providing more liquidity to the financial system with the goal of reducing short-term interest rates.","09","19",5
"As for the Eurozone, the growth outlook remains low, rising at 1.1% for both 2019 and 2020, affected by uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit process from the European Union (Brexit) and global trade disputes. Considering this adverse outlook and low inflation levels, the European Central Bank announced a package of expansive measures, highlighting the reduction in the interest rate of the permanent deposit facility (overnight), placing it at -0.50% per annum. It also announced a new round of purchases of sovereign debt assets in a monthly amount of $20 billion, as well as a liquidity provision program for the private sector credit pipeline through financial institutions.","09","19",6
"On the other hand, Latin America's growth projections have deteriorated, projecting a regional expansion of 0.5% by 2019 according to Consensus Forecasts. The region's performance would be influenced by recessionary conditions in Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua, while the two largest economies, Brazil and Mexico, would grow below 1.0%. This combination of lower growth and volatility in international markets has contributed to the sharps of the depreciations of almost all currencies in emerging economies, and in particular Latin America, in recent months.","09","19",7
"In terms of raw materials, the average Price of Texas Intermediate Oil (WTI) remained around US$55 per barrel during the month of September, despite having higher volatility associated with geopolitical tensions in oil-producing countries. The average price is expected to remain for the remainder of 2019 below $60 a barrel, a level set out in the National Budget, as a result of weakening global demand. On the other hand, the average price of gold remained above $1,500 per troy ounce in September, as it was used as a haven of value in an environment of high uncertainty.","09","19",8
"In the domestic context, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates that aggregate demand has begun to recover in response to the recent implementation of expansive monetary measures. Indeed, after cumulative growth of 4.7% during the first half of the year, the economy expanded by 4.6% year-on-year in July and accelerated to 4.8% year-on-year in August. If this positive trend continues over the coming months, economic growth is expected to hover around its 5.0% potential by the end of the year.","09","19",9
"In particular, monetary easing measures implemented since June, through the reduction by 100 basis points of the monetary policy rate and the release of more than RD$34 billion of legal lace resources to the productive sectors, have boosted private credit, which expands year-on-year by around 11%. Monetary conditions will remain favourable over the coming months as monetary policy transmission mechanisms operate, boosting domestic demand through increased investment and private consumption.","09","19",10
"On the other hand, the process of consolidation of public finances is maintained, with a primary surplus expected to be achieved at the end of 2019, as stipulated in the National Budget. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as foreign direct investment and remittances continue to perform well, compensating for recent tourism moderation, induced by lower global demand and the negative media campaign in the face of isolated cases in the sector. In this complex international environment, the Dominican Republic has maintained the relative stability of the exchange rate, presenting during this year a cumulative depreciation below the average of Latin American countries and emerging economies, as a result of the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and credibility in its economic policies.","09","19",11
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.

The forecast models suggest that in the monetary policy horizon, inflation would remain within the range established in the Monetary Program, while market expectations remain anchored around the target in the medium term.","10","12",2
"In the external context, the latest projections of the IMF World Economic Outlook confirm the slow recovery of advanced countries while revealing the process of slowdown experienced by emerging economies. Financial tensions in the countries of the Eurozone have moderated, but the recession persists while uncertainty remains about its final correction. The announcement of a third round of quantitative easing in the United States would help to improve the economic conditions of that country in the short term while the dollar would tend to depreciate.","10","12",3
"In the domestic sphere, domestic demand and production continue to evolve in positive terrain, although below its potential.

The forecast of growth of the IMF for the United States of America (EUA) is 1.6% for 2013 and 2.6% for 2014. On the other hand, it is expected that the economy of the Eurozone will contract this year by 0.4%, recovering in 2014 with an expansion of around 1%. In Latin America, projections point to regional growth of 2.7% in 2013 and 3.1% in 2014.","10","13",3
"Recently, the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) decided to maintain its TPM between 0% and 0.25% and continue with its program of purchase of financial assets for US $ 85 billion per month. This decision reduced the long-term international interest rates, helped to soften the trend towards the appreciation of the dollar and improved the expectations of the emerging economies that had been affected by the outflow of capital due to the uncertainty of a possible reversal of monetary policy. of the FED. The temporary fiscal agreement, after the closure of the US government, also helped to reduce pressures on international financial conditions that were quite restrictive. The international prices of raw materials are reduced below their value for the last two quarters.","10","13",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand show an important improvement over the performance shown at the beginning of the year. The Gross Domestic Product grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, for an accumulated 2.9% in January-September, which indicates that by the end of the year it would be meeting the 3.0% projection of the Monetary Program. Product growth during the first nine months of the year is consistent with an expansion of credit to the private sector in national currency of around 15% per annum in the month of September. It is expected that in the last quarter of the year, the relative stability of the exchange rate will be maintained, given the entry of important flows from sovereign bonds, pending disbursements from multilateral organizations, tourists and absent Dominicans who visit us at Christmas and the contributions of Barrick Gold.","10","13",5

"At its monetary policy meeting for the month of October 2014, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate unchanged at 6.25% per annum, in line with the neutral position it has maintained in recent months.","10","14",1
"The decision on the benchmark interest rate took into account the balance of risks around the inflation projections, as well as the performance of the rest of the main macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. Last September, cumulative inflation in the nine months computed stood at 2.53%, while the interannual rate of inflation fell to 2.83%, below the lower end of the target range of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2014 In the same way, the interannual core inflation, which is related to monetary conditions, fell from 3.26% in August to 3.07% in September. It is important to note that inflation in recent months has been influenced by low inflationary pressures of external origin, and it is expected that it will be within the target range in the policy horizon.","10","14",2
"In the external context, the most recent data maintain the positive economic outlook for the United States of America. The Federal Reserve concluded its policy of monetary stimulus by buying financial assets, indicating that it would keep the monetary policy interest rate unchanged for extended time, between 0% and 0.25% until mid-2015, while consolidating the recovery of that economy and continues to improve labor market conditions.","10","14",3
"In the case of the Eurozone, economic activity remains moderate, projecting an expansion in 2014 and 2015 of 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, with the risk of a deflation scenario. For Latin America, a lower economic dynamism is projected, with a GDP growth of 1.2% expected in 2014 to reach 2.2% in 2015 due to signs of recession in countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, and moderate performance in other important economies of the region. .","10","14",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity maintained a positive growth trend, expanding by 7.0% during the January-September period, with a growth rate of over 6.0% for the whole year of 2014. As a reflection of this dynamism, credit to The private sector in domestic currency is expanding at an interannual rate of more than 15.0% and would converge at rates close to 12.0% at the end of the year, in line with nominal GDP growth. On the fiscal policy side, budget execution points to a smaller deficit than expected in 2014 (2.8%), because revenues grow at an annual rate higher than that of public spending.","10","14",5
"Tourism and remittances reflect a better than expected performance, which, together with the drop registered in the prices of oil and other raw materials, would contribute to the improvement in external accounts, projecting that the current account deficit closed at 3.9% of the GDP in 2014. The IMF forecasts that the trend in the price of oil will continue to moderate for 2015, with which it is estimated that there would be a reduction of some US $ 600 million in the Dominican oil bill. Due to this effect, a significant reduction in the current account deficit is projected at levels between 2.9% and 3.1% of GDP by the end of 2015, a situation that will favor the relative stability of the exchange rate as important foreign currency savings take place. At the same time, it would allow the Central Bank to continue strengthening its levels of international reserves.","10","14",6

"At its monetary policy meeting in October 2015, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.00% per annum.","10","15",1
"The decision on the reference rate was adopted after a complete analysis of the balance of risks around inflation projections, market expectations, the national macroeconomic outlook and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. It was observed that in September the year-on-year inflation rate stood at 0.39% and that, in cumulative terms, inflation reached 1.33% at the end of that month. On the other hand, core inflation, an indicator that reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, was 1.90% year-on-year in September. Forecasts indicate that inflation would approach the lower limit of the target established in the Monetary Program for the end of 2015, gradually converging towards the center of the range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% in 2016.","10","15",2
"In the external context, according to the Consensus Forecast, world production would grow 2.6% in 2015, accelerating to 3.0% in 2016, driven by the performance of developed economies, which have benefited from important monetary stimuli. According to forecasts made during the month of October by Consensus, the economy of the United States of America (USA) would grow 2.5% in 2015 and 2.7% in 2016, while the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand by 1.4% and 1.7% during those years, respectively. Inflation in the industrialized economies of Europe and the US would remain low, close to zero, during the current year. For 2016, the US Consumer Price Index would increase to 1.9%, close to its medium-term goal, while inflation in the ZE would be 1.2%. It should be noted that the labor market, both in the US and the ZE, shows reductions in unemployment. In the United States, the unemployment rate stood at 5.1% in September, a level considered to be full employment by the Federal Reserve. In the Euro Zone, the unemployment rate fell from 11.0% to 10.8% in the month of September.","10","15",3
"In another order, the main economies of emerging markets continue to slow their growth and some of them, as is the case in Brazil, remain in recession. China registered a growth of 6.9% during the third quarter, well below the average of the last decade. According to the International Monetary Fund, China's economy would grow 6.8% this year and 6.3% next year. Taking into account this behavior of China and other large emerging economies, as well as the risks arising from the global economy, the US Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate unchanged at its most recent monetary policy meeting.","10","15",4
"In the case of Latin America, a contraction of 0.7% is projected in 2015, recovering gradually in 2016 with a moderate growth of 0.5%. This year's Latin American performance is highly influenced by the estimated contraction of the economies of Brazil (-2.8%) and Venezuela (-7.8%), as well as by the projected low growth for Argentina (0.9%) and the slowdown in the growth of other important exporters of commodities, such as Chile (2.1%) and Peru (2.7%).","10","15",5
"In international markets, the tendency to the appreciation of the dollar is maintained, while oil prices continue below the average of recent years. This behavior has contributed to low inflation in the United States and Europe, in contrast to what happened in the large countries of Latin America, exporters of raw materials, where exchange rate depreciation has generated higher inflation.","10","15",6
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity in the Dominican Republic continues to show high dynamism in the short term. In that sense, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) presents a real growth rate of 6.7% in interannual terms in January-September. The growth was even greater in the July-September period, at 7.1%, according to preliminary figures. Consistent with this dynamic of growth, loans to the private sector in local currency grew at an annual rate of around 11.2% as of October, in line with the expansion of nominal GDP.","10","15",7
"In the context of fiscal policy, budget execution points to the government continuing its process of fiscal consolidation, reaching a primary surplus in the current year. According to the Budget approved for 2016, consolidation would continue during that year with a primary surplus of around 0.7% of GDP. and a deficit for the year equivalent to 2.3% of GDP. With regard to the external sector, the macroeconomic fundamentals are consolidated with a current account balance that would close the year with its lowest deficit in the last decade, due to lower oil prices and the better performance of income from tourism, remittances and exports of free zones. These positive results in the fiscal and external accounts, would facilitate the accumulation of reserves and the relative stability of the exchange market.","10","15",8
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to implement monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to take the necessary measures against risks to the stability of the economy. prices and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","10","15",9
"At its monetary policy meeting in October 2016, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to increase its monetary policy rate (MPR) by 50 basis points, from 5.00% per annum to 5.50% per annum, effective November 1. According to the BCRD's short-term liquidity management scheme, the rate of paid deposits (overnight) is increased from 3.50% to 4.00% per annum and the rate of expansion facilities (repos) increases from 6.50% to 7.00% annual.","10","16",1
"The decision regarding the reference rate has a preventive character and seeks to generate certainty for economic agents. This measure takes into account the balance of risks around inflation projections, market expectations, the domestic macroeconomic context, as well as the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy; in particular the upward expectations of Federal Reserve interest rates (FED), the recent trend of higher international oil prices and the uncertainty that the electoral process of the United States of America (USA) has generated in international markets, among others. In September, the interannual inflation rate stood at 1.35%, while cumulative inflation reached 0.35% at the end of that month. Likewise, the interannual core inflation, related to monetary conditions, amounted to 1.78 percent.","10","16",2
"Although inflation has remained persistently below the target range and the economy has grown at rates above its potential, this behavior is due to the positive supply shock, mainly associated with the fall in international oil prices. However, during the last months there has been a gradual increase in oil prices, while projections indicate that this process would continue in the policy horizon. In that sense, the inflation projections for 2017 indicate a moderate upward trend, which could imply potential risks of deviations from the inflation target of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%. In the same way, higher oil prices would have an impact on the projected result of the Current Account. Likewise, according to data from the Macroeconomic Expectations Survey, we observe an upward behavior of market inflation expectations by economic agents.","10","16",3
"In the external environment, the United States of America recorded a growth rate of 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of the year, exceeding market expectations for that period. This result strengthens the probability that the Federal Reserve will resume the normalization of its monetary policy rate in the coming months. According to the most recent information from the Consensus Forecast, the US would grow 1.5% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017. It should be noted that in the international financial markets there has been some uncertainty regarding the US electoral process and its possible impact on external liquidity conditions. . Given the electoral uncertainty in the US, some emerging economies, such as Mexico, have presented volatility in their exchange markets.","10","16",4
"On the other hand, the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand at interannual rates of around 1.6% in the current year, supported by the performance of Germany (1.8%) and Spain (3.1%). For 2017, this region would experience a moderate slowdown, growing 1.3% year-on-year, probably influenced by the impact of Brexit.","10","16",5
"In Latin America, Consensus Forecast expects a contraction of economic activity of -0.3% this year, slightly better than the previous projections of -0.5% for the region. The low projected growth for Latin America this year is explained by significant recessions in countries such as: Venezuela (-10.3%); Brazil (-3.2%); Ecuador (-2.0%); and Argentina (-1.6%). It is important to point out that contrary to what happens with these commodity exporting economies, the economies of Central America, oil importers, have kept growing with low levels of inflation in 2016. By 2017, Latin America would grow around 2.1%, being Venezuela (-3.5%) the only economy that would remain in recession.","10","16",6
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity continues to expand at a rate above its potential. In January-September, the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 6.9% year-on-year and current forecasts indicate that economic growth at the end of the year would be 6.5%, the highest in Latin America for the third consecutive year. To the extent that the positive supply shock dissipates, that is to say that oil prices present an upward trajectory, real GDP would converge to its potential level in the policy horizon. In the financial sector, credit to the private sector in national currency expanded at a rate of around 12.0% year-on-year in October, growing above nominal GDP and beyond that contemplated in the Monetary Program.","10","16",7
"In the fiscal sector, public spending has decelerated noticeably in the second half of the year and it is expected that by the end of 2016 the deficit will approach what was stipulated in the latest projection of the National Budget, consolidating around 2.3% of GDP for Next year. On the side of external sector accounts, the current account deficit would end 2016 with a deficit close to 1.7% of GDP. This context of solid macroeconomic fundamentals, together with the Central Bank's preventive decision to increase its Monetary Policy Rate, contributes to maintain propitious conditions to accumulate international reserves and promote the relative stability of the exchange market.","10","16",8
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to continue conducting monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures in the face of risks regarding price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","10","16",9
"At its monetary policy meeting in October 2017, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% per annum.","10","17",1
"The decision on the reference rate was made after reviewing the balance of risks around the inflation forecasts, the evolution of the main national macroeconomic indicators, the international environment relevant to the Dominican economy, market expectations and the projections of that set of variables. Monthly inflation was 0.64% in September, while the accumulated rate at the ninth month of the year stood at 2.42%. Likewise, year-on-year inflation reached 3.80%, close to the center of the Monetary Program's target range. Additionally, core inflation, related to monetary conditions, was 2.29% year-on-year. The projections indicate that, at the end of this year, inflation would be around the lower limit of the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%.","10","17",2
"In the external context, the growth of the world economy has presented a performance better than expected in the second half of the year, attributed to the expansion of production in advanced economies, while inflationary pressures remain contained. According to Consensus Forecast, the United States of America (USA) would grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.4% in 2018, while the product of the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand by 2.2% and 1.8%, during those years. The inflationary pressures of the developed economies remain relatively low, projecting 2.0% for the US in 2017 and 2018, as well as inflation rates of 1.5% in 2017 and 1.3% in 2018 for the ZE.","10","17",3
"In Latin America there is a gradual economic recovery, with the exception of Venezuela. Consensus Forecast projections indicate that the region's economy would grow 1.7% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018, driven by more favorable terms of trade. The dynamism of the advanced economies together with the better expected performance in the emerging economies would have a positive impact on the global economic activity that, according to the International Monetary Fund, would grow 3.1% in 2017 and 2018.","10","17",4
"International prices of primary goods have increased in recent months. The price of a barrel of West Texas oil (WTI) reached US $ 54 at the end of October. However, it is expected that by the end of the year it will be around US $ 52.0 a barrel, below the price observed at the end of 2016. International financial conditions remain favorable for emerging economies in the short term due to the abundant liquidity Worldwide.","10","17",5
"Domestically, economic activity maintains positive prospects registering a growth of 4.0% in the period January-August 2017. The decrease in monetary policy rates, together with the measure to reduce the legal reserve of 2.2 percentage points, have had a multiplying effect on loans to the private sector in national currency, which have increased by almost RD $ 24 billion pesos, in less than three months.","10","17",6
"Recently, the Monetary Board eliminated the sectorization in the use of legal reserve, so that the RD $ 11,515 million pending placement of the resources of the legal reserve, could be lent to any sector that demands it. This measure, together with the entry into force of some aspects of the Asset Evaluation Regulation (REA), particularly for the benefit of sectors such as agriculture and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MIPYMES), will have a favorable impact on credit, employment and the growth of the economy. At the end of October, private credit in national currency grew around 10% year-on-year.","10","17",7
"With regard to fiscal policy, the Government maintains its commitment to the deficit target established in the National Budget, while strengthening the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. On the other hand, the external sector shows a positive behavior, contributing to the increase in foreign exchange earnings and creating a favorable environment for the relative stability of the foreign exchange market and for the accumulation of international reserves.","10","17",8

"Cumulative inflation as of September stood at 1.52%, while year-on-year inflation, from September 2017 to September 2018, fell for the third consecutive month, going from 3.87% in August to 3.29% in September, staying within the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program.","10","18",3
"Core inflation, linked to monetary conditions, fell to 2.53% year-on-year in September. The forecast system indicates that, on average, inflation would remain within the target range in the two-year monetary policy horizon. In the external context, the relevant economic outlook for the Dominican economy is influenced by the normalization of monetary policy in the United States of America (USA), the appreciation of the dollar in international markets and the gradual increase in oil prices. Other factors such as the increase in volatility in international capital markets, global trade tensions and the increase in uncertainty in some emerging economies also contribute to what is perceived as a changing international scenario.","10","18",4
"In this context, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 3.2% in 2018 and 3.1% in 2019, driven by the continued dynamism of the US economy that would expand 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively, during those years. Given the growth of the US in the context of full employment and inflation above the programmed target, it is expected that the process of increases in the benchmark interest rate of the Federal Reserve Bank will continue. It should be noted that the normalization process of monetary policy has been accompanied by an expansive fiscal policy that has increased the public deficit in that country, which is estimated to be around 4.0% of GDP by 2018. On the other hand, the economy of the community of countries that make up the Euro Zone (ZE) would grow 2.0% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019. Given that inflationary pressures remain moderate in these countries, the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank would remain expansive in the medium term, which would help to increase the interest rate differential with the US, promoting a greater appreciation of the dollar.","10","18",5
"The economic situation for emerging markets shows a greater degree of uncertainty, with a slowdown observed in some economies with weak macroeconomic fundamentals. However, there are emerging economies that show significant dynamism, such as the cases of India and China whose economies would expand during 2018 by 7.3% and 6.6%, respectively. In the case of Latin America, the growth projections of countries such as Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Nicaragua have been corrected downwards. On the other hand, the growth prospects of other economies in the region with solid foundations such as Chile, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic have been revised upwards. Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential. In effect, the real Gross Domestic Product expanded by 6.9% during the first nine months of 2018, driven by a year-on-year growth of 7.3% in the third quarter. According to the Central Bank's forecasting system, economic activity would continue to grow above its potential in the current year, closing 2018 with growth of around 6.5%. Consistent with this trend, credit to the private sector in national currency continues to expand close to 12% year-on-year to the month of October, while monetary aggregates present growth rates consistent with the estimated expansion of nominal GDP.","10","18",6
"On the fiscal policy side, the evolution of public finances over the course of the year suggests that the Central Government would close in December near the deficit target set in the 2018 Budget. As of September, the growth rate of the income is of two digits, at the same time as the public expenditure expands moderately. In the external sector, the foreign exchange generating activities maintain a remarkable dynamism, foreseeing that the Current Account deficit is located slightly above -1.0% of GDP at the end of the year, associated with higher oil prices. The good performance of the external sector has facilitated the accumulation of international reserves, which remain at levels above US $ 7,000 million, which contributes to the relative stability of the foreign exchange market.","10","18",7
"The consolidation process of public finances and the low current account deficits, in a context of high economic growth and controlled inflation, are a reflection of our strong macroeconomic fundamentals. In effect, the country risk perception indicator for the Dominican Republic calculated by the JP Morgan firm (EMBI) is at the end of October about 100 basis points below the risk indicator for Latin America, being This is the level of risk relative to the lowest region in history, which reflects the confidence of investors in the Dominican economy based on the strength of its fundamentals. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability, as well as to ensure the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems. In this sense, the monetary institution remains attentive to the evolution of the monetary policy normalization of the United States and its impact on the interest rate differential with the Dominican Republic, as well as the price of oil and the dynamics of the dollar in the international market, and is ready to react in a timely manner to any factor that jeopardizes compliance with its inflation target.","10","18",8

Taking into account the lower dynamism of economic activity and low inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve decreased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points in October, for the third consecutive time. In addition, the Federal Reserve has been providing greater liquidity to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) and Treasury bill purchases on the secondary market, with the goal of lowering short-term interest rates and normalizing the yield curve, which had been reversed in recent months reflecting short-term interest rates higher than long-term interest rates.

"In October, the year-on-year inflation rate rose to 2.82%, while core interannual inflation fell to 3.31%. It is expected that by the end of 2012 it will be below the lower limit of the goal. However, the decision to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged is based on the fact that the most recent projections indicate that inflation in 2013 would be within the target of 5% <U+00B1> 1 percentage point and market expectations are consistent with these predictions. In the monetary policy horizon, the forecast models show that inflation would remain within the target.","11","12",2
"In the external context, the situation of the Euro Zone has deteriorated, while the United States (USA) shows a higher growth rate in the third quarter of the year, higher than expected by the market. The risks related to the fiscal situation in the European Union and in the United States have increased, generating uncertainty at an international level. Some Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, show signs of weakening in their growth rate. The prices of primary goods tend to moderate, while the US dollar has experienced some appreciation.","11","12",3

In monthly terms, September inflation was 0.49%, while core inflation, the indicator of price performance that best reflects the monetary policy stance, recorded a year-on-year rate of 4.83%.","11","13",2
"In the external context, the growth outlook for the world economy, according to the IMF, has moderated during the current year (2.9%). For 2014, a better performance is expected (3.6%), as a result of a significant improvement in the advanced economies. The forecast of growth of the IMF for the United States of America (EUA) is 1.6% for 2013 and 2.6% for 2014. On the other hand, it is expected that the economy of the Eurozone will contract this year by 0.4%, recovering in 2014 with an expansion of around 1%. In Latin America, projections point to regional growth of 2.7% in 2013 and 3.1% in 2014.","11","13",3
"Recently, the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) decided to maintain its TPM between 0% and 0.25% and continue with its program of purchase of financial assets for US $ 85 billion per month. This decision reduced the long-term international interest rates, helped to soften the trend towards the appreciation of the dollar and improved the expectations of the emerging economies that had been affected by the outflow of capital due to the uncertainty of a possible reversal of monetary policy. of the FED. The temporary fiscal agreement, after the closure of the US government, also helped to reduce pressures on international financial conditions that were quite restrictive. The international prices of raw materials are reduced below their value for the last two quarters.","11","13",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand show an important improvement over the performance shown at the beginning of the year. The Gross Domestic Product grew by 5.5% in the third quarter, for an accumulated 2.9% in January-September, which indicates that by the end of the year it would be meeting the 3.0% projection of the Monetary Program. Product growth during the first nine months of the year is consistent with an expansion of credit to the private sector in national currency of around 15% per annum in the month of September. It is expected that in the last quarter of the year, the relative stability of the exchange rate will be maintained, given the entry of important flows from sovereign bonds, pending disbursements from multilateral organizations, tourists and absent Dominicans who visit us at Christmas and the contributions of Barrick Gold.","11","13",5

Likewise, inflation The interannual core, which is related to monetary conditions, was reduced to 3.11%. It should be noted that the recent evolution of inflation has been influenced by the fall in prices of external origin, particularly in oil. It is expected that inflation will be within the target range in the policy horizon.","11","14",2
"In the external context, the most recent data confirm the favorable economic conditions of the United States of America (USA), our main trading partner. Indeed, the most recent information on US growth shows an expansion of 3.9% in the third quarter of the year, better than expected by the market. According to the Consensus Forecast, the EUA would grow 2.2% in the current year, expecting an even greater expansion by 2015, around 3.0%. Despite this dynamism, the market expects the Federal Reserve of the United States (FED) to maintain the monetary policy interest rate unchanged, between 0% and 0.25% until mid-2015. This policy position is consistent with the recovery of the labor market, which registered an unemployment rate of 5.8% in October, showing a trend towards what the FED considers its potential unemployment rate at around 5.25%.","11","14",3
"On the other hand, economic activity in the Eurozone remains moderate, projecting an expansion of 0.8% in 2014 and 1.1% in 2015, according to Consensus Forecast. Latin America has been affected by the decline in commodity prices in international markets, slowing growth in some of the largest economies, particularly in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Consensus Forecast projects an economic expansion in this region that is lower than in recent years, with GDP growth expected of 1.0% in 2014 and 1.8% in 2015.","11","14",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity maintained a positive growth trend as it expanded 7.2% during the January-September period, with a growth rate of more than 6.5% expected for the whole of 2014. As a reflection of this dynamism, credit to The private sector in national currency is expanding satisfactorily and is expected to close the year with a growth rate close to 14.0% year-on-year. The macroeconomic accounts show a significant improvement, with projections of current account deficit of 3.9% of GDP for 2014 and in the range 2.9% -3.1% of GDP for 2015, a situation that will favor the relative stability of the exchange rate, at the same time that would allow the Central Bank to continue strengthening its levels of international reserves. Likewise, the fiscal deficit for this year would be around 2.8% of GDP, while the 2015 Budget contemplates a deficit of 2.4% of GDP, product of a primary surplus of 0.5% of GDP, which would help to improve the sustainability of the debt.","11","14",5

"At its monetary policy meeting in November 2015, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.00% per annum.","11","15",1
"The decision on the benchmark rate was preceded by a broad analysis of the macroeconomic outlook, including the risk balance around inflation projections, market expectations and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. It was observed that in the month of October, the interannual rate of inflation amounted to 1.23% and that, in cumulative terms, inflation reached 2.08% until that month. Additionally, core inflation, which reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, remained at 1.91% year-on-year.

"In the external context, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 2.6% in 2015, accelerating to 2.9% in 2016, driven by the performance of developed countries. The United States of America (USA) would experience an expansion rate of around 2.4% in 2015 and 2.6% in 2016, while the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand by 1.5% and 1.7% during those years, respectively. Inflation in the industrialized economies of Europe and the US would remain close to zero during 2015. By 2016, it would increase by around 1.7% in the US and 1.1% in the EZ, in an environment of lower unemployment.","11","15",3
"On the other hand, the outlook for the main emerging economies continues to fall, with the recession in Brazil and the slowdown in the rest of the net exporter economies of primary goods in Latin America, projecting a contraction of -0.8% in 2015 and recovering gradually in 2016, with a moderate growth of 0.2%. The Latin American economic panorama in 2015 is influenced by the estimated contraction of the economies of Brazil (-3.0%) and Venezuela (-8.0%), as well as by the projected low growth for Argentina (1.0%) and the deceleration of the growth of others important exporters of commodities, such as Chile (2.1%) and Peru (2.8%).","11","15",4
"For its part, China's economy would grow 6.8% this year and 6.3% next year, below the average of the last decade, according to projections from the International Monetary Fund. In the international exchange markets, the tendency to the appreciation of the US dollar continues, while the prices of primary goods, particularly oil and gold, continue below the average of recent years.","11","15",5
"Domestically, economic activity evolves favorably in the short term. The recent IMF mission that evaluated national economic conditions reaffirmed that the Dominican Republic continues to be among the most dynamic economies in the region. In that sense, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projected for 2015 contemplates a real growth rate in the range 6.5% -7.0%. Consistent with the evolution of nominal GDP, loans to the private sector in national currency grew at an interannual rate of around 11.0% as of November.","11","15",6
"Regarding the external sector, the current account balance would end the year with the lowest deficit in the last ten years, around 2.0% of GDP, due to lower oil prices and the good performance of revenues from tourism, remittances and exports of free zones. With regard to fiscal policy, the projection of the primary surplus in the current year is maintained, while for 2016, a primary surplus of around 0.7% of GDP is contemplated. These positive results in the external and fiscal accounts would facilitate the accumulation of reserves and the relative stability of the exchange market.","11","15",7

"At its November 2016 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to maintain its monetary policy rate (MPR) at 5.5% per year.","11","16",1
"Although the conditions that led to a preventive increase of the MPR at the last meeting are maintained, such as the expected increase in the monetary policy interest rate of the Federal Reserve, the gradual increase in oil prices and the expectations generated around it. to the electoral process of the United States, the BCRD chose to keep its reference rate unchanged. This decision was taken while waiting for more information about the economic impact that could be generated by extreme climatic events that occurred recently.","11","16",2
"The decision regarding the reference rate weighs the balance of risks on the inflation projections based on the analysis of the main internal macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. In October, the year-on-year inflation rate decreased to 0.91%, while cumulative inflation to the tenth month of 2016 was 0.65%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation, related to monetary conditions, remained at 1.78 percent.","11","16",3
"In the external context, contrary to expectations, the markets' reaction has tended to increase the stock market indicators after the recent elections in the United States of America (USA). At the same time, the dollar has strengthened and long-term interest rates have increased due to a higher probability of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve Bank. In this context, Consensus Forecast estimates that the US economy would grow 1.5% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017. On the other hand, the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand around 1.6% in 2016, supported by the performance of Germany ( 1.8%) and Spain (3.1%), mainly. For 2017, this region would experience a moderate slowdown, growing 1.3% year-on-year, influenced by the impact of Brexit and the uncertainty in France and Italy, countries that face short-term electoral processes.","11","16",4
"In Latin America (AL), the indicators of most of the capital markets in the region have shown a downward trend in recent weeks. In the real sector, the LA economy is still in recession. According to Consensus Forecast, the region would contract by -0.4% in the current year due to important recessions in countries such as: Venezuela (-10.3%); Brazil (-3.3%); Ecuador (-2.0%); and Argentina (-2.0%). Contrary to the prospects of these export economies of primary goods, Central America and the Dominican Republic, countries that have benefited from the low prices of commodities, particularly oil, experience positive growth rates with low levels of inflation. For 2017, Latin America would grow around 2.1%, with Venezuela (-3.2%) the only economy that would remain in recession.","11","16",5
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand evolve favorably in the short term, growing above its potential level. The economy is expected to grow in the range of 6.0% -6.5%, the highest growth in the region, even considering the possible negative effects of the recent floods on the results of the fourth quarter. Credit to the private sector in national currency continues to expand at a rate close to 12.0% in November and would close the year with an expansion greater than the estimated nominal product.","11","16",6
"With regard to fiscal policy, the growth rate of public spending has slowed significantly in the second half of the year, which implies a more restrictive fiscal stance and in line with the projection of a deficit of 2.7% of GDP, presented in the latest revision of the Budget for the current year. It is expected that reconstruction efforts in areas of the country affected by the recent floods will have a moderate impact on the fiscal deficit without generating a significant deviation from the estimate of the deficit by the end of the year. In the external sector, a current account deficit is expected around -1.7% of GDP for the current year. This context of solid macroeconomic fundamentals contributes to maintaining favorable conditions to accumulate international reserves and promote the relative stability of the exchange market.","11","16",7

"The monthly inflation rate for October was 0.0%, so that accumulated inflation at the tenth month of the year remained unchanged at 2.42%. Year-on-year inflation reached 3.48%, within the center of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program. Additionally, core inflation, related to monetary conditions, decreased to 2.23% year-on-year. Forecasts indicate that inflation would remain within the target range in the monetary policy horizon of 24 months.","11","17",3
"In the external context, according to the Consensus Forecast, the outlook for the world economy remains favorable, projecting an expansion rate of around 3.1% in 2017 and 2018. Likewise, the International Monetary Fund, in its report World Economic Outlook (WEO) , for its acronym in English), projected an expansion of the global economy of 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018. The greater dynamism in the world economy is the result of improvements in the growth of the advanced economies, while the Inflationary pressures remain contained. The United States of America (USA) would grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018, a more optimistic scenario than the previous month, while the product of the Euro Zone (ZE) would expand by 2.2% and 1.9%, during those years. Inflation in these economies would remain relatively low, projecting 2.1% for the US in 2017 and 2018 and inflations of 1.5% and 1.3%, during the same period for the ZE.","11","17",4
"Latin America continues to recover gradually and has emerged from the recession that hit it last year, with the exception of Venezuela. In that sense, the economy of the region would grow 1.7% in 2017 and 2.6% in 2018, according to Consensus Forecast. International prices of primary goods have tended to rise in recent months, mainly oil, while international financial conditions remain relatively favorable for emerging economies in the short term due to the abundant liquidity worldwide.","11","17",5
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity was affected in September by the impact of the Irma and Mar<ed>a storms in sectors such as tourism and agriculture. However, preliminary figures show that in October there was an important recovery, as a result of the effects on domestic demand of the monetary easing measures taken in the month of July. It should be noted that the reduction in the MPR of 50 basis points, together with the reduction in the legal reserve of 2.2 percentage points in July, has had a large multiplier effect on credit to the private sector in national currency. Since these measures were adopted, private loans in national currency have grown by more than RD $ 41 billion, for an average of more than RD $ 10 billion per month, almost three times more than the average monthly growth of the first half of the year. In year-on-year terms, private credit in local currency grew around 11.0% year-on-year, in line with the rate of expansion of the Circulating Medium M1.","11","17",6
"Regarding fiscal policy, the Government maintains its commitment to the deficit target of 2.3% of GDP established in the National Budget, while strengthening coordination between monetary and fiscal policies.

"The decision to leave the reference rate unchanged is based on a detailed analysis of the balance of risks around inflation forecasts, including information from international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. Accumulated inflation as of October stood at 1.75%, while year-on-year inflation, from October 2017 to October 2018, reached 3.52%, remaining within the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program.","11","18",2
"On the other hand, core inflation, linked to monetary conditions, recorded a year-on-year change of 2.60% in October. The forecast system indicates that inflation would close below the lower limit of the target range in the current year, gradually converging to the midpoint of that range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% in the two-year monetary policy horizon.","11","18",3
"In the external environment, the relevant economic outlook for the Dominican economy remains conditioned by the normalization of monetary policy in the United States of America (USA), the appreciation of the dollar in international markets and the increase in uncertainty in some emerging economies . On the other hand, during the last month, there has been a significant reduction in international oil prices associated with a moderation in geopolitical tensions among oil producing countries and the outlook for lower demand associated with the risk of a slowdown in world economy .","11","18",4
"In this context, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 3.2% in 2018 and 3.0% in 2019, driven by the US economy that would expand 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively, during those years. Given the dynamism shown by the US economy, the normalization process is expected to continue with an additional increase in the benchmark interest rate this year. On the other hand, the Euro Zone (ZE) is projected to grow 2.0% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019, noting that the growth prospects of some of its main economies, such as Germany, Italy and Spain, have been revised downwards. Given that inflationary pressures remain moderate in these countries, the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank would remain expansive in the medium term, which would contribute to increasing the interest rate differential with the US, contributing to maintain the appreciation of the dollar.","11","18",5
"Regarding emerging markets, a certain degree of uncertainty persists, with a slowdown observed in some economies with weak macroeconomic fundamentals. However, there are emerging economies that show significant dynamism, such as the cases of India and China whose economies would expand during 2018 by 7.3% and 6.6%, respectively. In the case of Latin America, the region is projected to grow 1.4% in 2018 and 2.0% in 2019, driven by the dynamism of economies in the region with solid foundations such as Chile, Peru, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. However, the growth projections of countries with economic vulnerabilities and socio-political tensions such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua continue to be corrected downwards.","11","18",6
"Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential, in a context of price stability. In effect, the real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 6.9% during the first nine months of 2018, driven mainly by investment and private consumption. According to the forecast system of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, economic activity would continue to be dynamic, closing the year 2018 with a growth of around 6.5%. On a consistent basis, monetary conditions remain favorable, characterized by an expansion of credit to the private sector in local currency close to 12% year-on-year at the end of November, while the growth rates of monetary aggregates are approaching the expansion of nominal GDP.","11","18",7
"On the fiscal policy side, the moderation in public spending continues to be maintained at 5% year-on-year in October, while the expansion in revenues exceeds 12% year-on-year, contributing to the process of consolidating finances public. In the foreign sector, foreign exchange generating activities, such as tourism, remittances and exports, maintain a remarkable dynamism, with the current account deficit being slightly above 1.0% of GDP at the end of the year, associated with the highest oil prices. The good performance of the external sector has facilitated the accumulation of international reserves, allowing reserve coverage levels that exceed 4 months of imports and contributing to the relative stability of the exchange rate.","11","18",8
"The proper management of monetary and fiscal policies have contributed to keeping inflation expectations of private agents anchored around the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%, while the country risk indicator of the Dominican Republic (EMBI) , for its acronym in English) remains significantly below the average risk perception for Latin America. In a changing international environment, the strength of the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Dominican Republic, accompanied by high economic growth and low inflation, give economic policies a greater capacity to react to any external shock that could put macroeconomic stability at risk.","11","18",9
"In this sense, the monetary institution remains attentive to the evolution of the monetary policy normalization of the United States, as well as the dynamics of the dollar and the price of oil in the international market, being prepared to react in a timely manner to any factor that puts at risk the fulfillment of its inflation goal.

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. At its November 2019 monetary policy meeting, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 4.50% per annum.","11","19",2
"The benchmark decision is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. October's monthly inflation was 0.67%, while cumulative inflation in the first ten months of the year stood at 3.06%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from October 2018 to October 2019, stood at 2.48%, remaining below the lower bound of the target range. Underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.23% in October. For their part, both the inflation expectations of economic analysts and the BCRD forecasting system, indicate that inflation would be closer to the center of the target range of 4.0% to 1.0% at the end of 2019 and would remain around the core value of the target by 2020.","11","19",3
"In the international environment, although the pockets of uncertainty that have been gravitating this year persist, some progress has been made in the negotiation process between the United States of America (USA) and China in the last month, which could lead to a potential trade agreement in the coming months. In this context, Consensus Forecasts maintains its moderate growth projection for the global economy of 2.5% in 2019, while the IMF forecasts a global expansion of 3.0% for this year.","11","19",4
"Economic activity in the U.S. has gradually slowed, projecting growth to move from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019 and 1.8% by 2020, according to Consensus. In the face of weakening the economy and low inflation, the Fed has reduced its benchmark rate three times, accumulating a 75 basis point decline in the year. In addition, the Fed has been providing greater liquidity to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) and purchases of Treasury bills on the secondary market, with the goal of reducing short-term interest rates. Going forward, market analysts do not expect additional adjustments to the federal funds rate until at least mid-2020s.","11","19",5
"As for the Euro Zone, the growth outlook remains low, rising at 1.1% and 1.0% for 2019 and 2020, respectively, conditioned by global trade disputes and uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit process from the European Union (Brexit). Considering the weak growth and lack of inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank continues to implement the recently announced package of expansionary measures, which include the liquidity provision programme for the private sector credit channeling and the purchase of sovereign bonds on the secondary market.","11","19",6
"On the other hand, in Latin America (AL) uncertainty has been heightened as a result of socio-political conflicts that have arisen in different Latin American countries, further deteriorating the regional growth outlook to 0.4%, according to Consensus and 0.2% according to the IMF. The region's weak economic performance is conditioned by negative growth rates this year in countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Mexico, as well as by Brazil's modest expansion and the negative impact of social demonstrations in countries such as Chile, Bolivia and Colombia.","11","19",7
"For raw materials, the average price of Texas intermediate oil (WTI) was around US$57 per barrel during the month of November, remaining below US$60 a barrel, a level as set out in the National Budget. On the other hand, the price of gold has remained at high levels, averaging US$1,475 per troy ounce in November, being used as a haven of value. This performance of oil and gold prices contributes to the continued favourable terms of trade of the Dominican Republic and benefit the external sector of the economy.","11","19",8
"In the domestic context, preliminary information from the Monthly Economic Activity Index (IMAE) indicates that domestic demand continues to react favourably following the implementation of monetary easing measures. Indeed, the economy expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in October, having reached 5.1% in September. Thus, the average growth over the January-October period was 4.8%. The dynamism of economic activity in recent months would help economic growth be around its potential of 5.0% by the end of the year.","11","19",9
"In particular, the expansionary monetary measures implemented since June, through the reduction by 100 basis points of the monetary policy rate and the release of more than RD$34 billion of legal lace resources to the productive sectors, have boosted private credit, which has increased by 11% so far this year and around 12% in the last twelve months. Monetary conditions will remain favourable over the coming months as monetary policy transmission mechanisms operate, boosting domestic demand through increased investment and private consumption.","11","19",10
"On the other hand, the process of consolidation of public finances is maintained, with a primary surplus expected to be achieved at the end of 2019, as stipulated in the National Budget. In the external sector, foreign exchange-generating activities such as foreign direct investment and remittances continue to perform well, compensating for the recent moderation of tourism, which is expected to recover in the coming months. In this complex international environment, the Dominican Republic has maintained relative exchange rate stability, recording a cumulative depreciation of below the average of AL countries and emerging economies this year as a result of the strength of macroeconomic fundamentals and credibility in its economic policies.","11","19",11
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to drive monetary policy towards achieving its inflation target and the smooth functioning of financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. In this sense, the institution will continue to monitor the moderation of the world economy and factors of uncertainty both externally and internally and its impact on aggregate demand, being prepared to continue to react in a timely manner to factors that may generate deviations from the inflation target and affect Dominican economic growth.","11","19",12
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, in its Monetary Policy Meeting of December 2012, decided to keep its Monetary Policy Interest Rate unchanged at 5.00% per annum. The Lombard Rate remains at 7.00% per annum.","12","12",1
"In the month of November, the interannual rate of inflation was 3.37% and it is expected that by the end of 2012 it would be around 4.0%, below the lower limit of the Monetary Program target. The decision on the benchmark interest rate takes into account that inflation in 2013 would be within the target of 5% <U+00B1> 1%, according to the BCRD forecast models. Market expectations remain in line with the BCRD's inflation projection, while no significant deviations are discernible with respect to inflation in the monetary policy horizon, even considering the impact of the tax reform on domestic prices.","12","12",2
"In the external context, the risks related to the fiscal situation of the industrialized countries remain high. The fiscal and debt crisis of the Euro Zone would cause the economy to remain in recession during 2013, with a fall in GDP of around 0.1%, according to analysts of the Economic Consensus. In the United States of America (USA), the inability to find a solution so far to the problem of the fiscal cliff (Fiscal Cliff, for its acronym in English) could generate new taxes and spending cuts of almost US $ 600 billion, affecting significantly the economic activity and with its sequel in the rest of the economies, especially in those that trade more closely with said nation. However, it is expected that some kind of agreement will soon be reached to solve this problem.","12","12",3
"For 2013, US growth would be 1.9%, a reduction from the 2.2% expected for 2012. Given this situation of moderate growth, the Federal Reserve has announced that it would maintain an expansive monetary policy for the next three years, which means maintaining low interest rates until 2015. For emerging economies, growth prospects show positive signs in an environment where large changes in the prices of primary goods are not expected. Given this international scenario, the monetary policy of the BCRD would maintain a prudent stance as long as inflation remains in line with the objective and there are no significant deviations from the fiscal targets established in the 2013 Budget.","12","12",4
"In the domestic sphere, the Gross Domestic Product projects a growth of around 4% by the end of 2012, still remaining below its potential capacity. For the year 2013, the macroeconomic framework contemplates a growth of 3.0% that could adjust positively if the behavior exhibited by private credit in the last five months is maintained. Indeed, after having contracted during all the months of the first semester of the year, starting in July, the credit in national currency of all financial institutions has grown by more than RD $ 30,000 million, in response to lower interest rates. If this behavior continues in 2013, there could be greater growth in private consumption and investment, with its consequent impact on domestic demand.","12","12",5
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation in order to react timely to risks on price stability and good functioning of the financial and payment systems.","12","12",6
"At its monetary policy meeting in December 2013, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 6.25% per annum unchanged.","12","13",1
"The decision regarding the leading rate takes into account inflation projections, as well as market expectations. The interannual inflation rate decreased for the third consecutive month, from its highest level of the year of 5.67% in the month of July, to 4.14% in November. Accumulated inflation to the eleventh month of 2013 was 3.49%, given the monthly variation of just 0.06%. Likewise, the interannual core inflation was reduced to 4.45%.","12","13",2
"In the external context, the outlook for the world economy has improved, driven by the process of gradual recovery exhibited by the industrialized economies. Emerging economies continue to grow, although they show a slight deceleration with respect to the levels reached in recent years. The growth of the United States of America was revised upwards, standing at 2.0% in year-on-year terms and 4.1% in annualized quarterly terms. This growth has contributed to reduce unemployment to 7.0%, a decrease of more than one percentage point so far this year. On the other hand, macroeconomic indicators point to Europe coming out of recession. Inflationary pressures remain low in line with the behavior of commodity prices during the current year.","12","13",3
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity and domestic demand show a dynamism of economic growth above 3.0%, projected in the macroeconomic framework for 2013. Credit to the private sector in national currency would be closing the year with a year-on-year growth greater than 13.5%, while improving prospects for activities related to foreign trade, mainly tourism, free zones and gold exports.","12","13",4

"At its monetary policy meeting in December 2014, the Central Bank maintained its monetary policy interest rate (MPR) at 6.25% per annum, a neutral stance that contributed to higher growth without generating monetary inflationary pressures.","12","14",1
"The decision on the benchmark interest rate was taken after an exhaustive analysis of the risk balance around the projections of inflation, growth and other macroeconomic indicators, as well as market expectations and the relevant international environment for the Dominican economy. Last November, accumulated inflation reached 2.30%, while the interannual rate stood at 2.68%, below the lower end of the target range of 4.5% <U+00B1> 1% for 2014. On the other hand, core inflation , related to the monetary conditions of the economy, was 3.14%. It is important to note that inflation continues to show a downward trend, driven by the continuous decline in the prices of primary goods in foreign markets, particularly oil. However, the forecasts indicate that inflation would return to the central point of the goal in the policy horizon.","12","14",2
"In the international environment, the world economy would grow 2.6% in 2014 and 3.0% in 2015, according to the Consensus Forecast, driven largely by the United States of America (USA), whose growth in the third quarter of the year was revised upwards from 3.9% to 5.0%. Consumption and private investment continue to be the main determinants of the dynamism shown by the US economy, so it is expected that the expansion process in our main trading partner will continue to have a positive impact on Dominican growth. The US unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in December and the Federal Reserve (FED) expects it to be reduced to 5.25% by the end of next year, thus reaching its full employment level. Given this panorama, the FED would keep its monetary policy interest rate unchanged until the second half of 2015. Regarding the Eurozone (ZE), the growth of the third quarter was 0.8%, led by Greece (1.7%), Spain (1.6%), Germany (1.2%) and Portugal (1.1%). According to Consensus Forecast, for 2014 and 2015, growth in the ZE of 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively, would be expected. For Latin America (AL), Consensus Forecast projects a growth of only 0.9% this year, with a recession in Venezuela and Argentina, while Brazil grows around zero. The fall in LA is explained by the end of the so-called ""Super Cycle of Commodities"" that benefited the largest economies in the region.","12","14",3
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity would end the year with a growth of around 7.0%, keeping close to its potential during 2015. The credit to the private sector in national currency that this year would register growth above 15%, would decrease gradually in 2015 to the range 10% -12%, rate around the growth of the nominal product expected for the coming year. In the external sector, the current account of the Balance of Payments would register a deficit of 3.5% of GDP in the current year, continuing its downward correction throughout 2015 to between 2.3% and 2.5% of GDP for the closing of the year. year. The favorable evolution of the external sector has contributed to maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market, closing the year with a year-on-year depreciation of around 3.5%. Additionally, it has facilitated the accumulation of gross international reserves (RIB), which will close the current year with a coverage of 3.1 months of imports. By 2015, the RIBs could exceed US $ 5,000 million, increasing import coverage to 3.2 months. The 2015 Budget contemplates a fiscal deficit of 2.4% of GDP, which is another indication of the solid foundations maintained by the Dominican economy.","12","14",4

"At its monetary policy meeting for the month of December 2015, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.00% per annum.","12","15",1
"The decision on the reference rate is based on a thorough analysis of the international and domestic environment, relevant to the Dominican economy, as well as the balance of risks around inflation forecasts and market expectations. It was observed that to the month of November, in accumulated terms, inflation reached 2.25%. Likewise, the interannual rate of inflation amounted to 1.54% that month. Additionally, core inflation, which reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, fell to 1.80% year-on-year. Inflation would end, at the end of the year, around the lower limit of the target established in the Monetary Program for 2015, gradually converging towards the center of the range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% in 2016.","12","15",2
"In the external context, the Federal Reserve (FED) began the process of normalizing its monetary policy, with an increase of 25 basis points in its federal funds rate. According to the FED, this increase should not have harmful effects on the performance of the US economy, so the monetary institution maintains its growth prospects around its potential and inflation close to 2.0% in the medium term. The unemployment rate in the United States of America (USA) would remain around the level considered of full employment. A point to be highlighted is that the FED's decision would help to increase international interest rates and maintain the appreciation of the dollar in global capital markets.","12","15",3
"Regarding the most recent economic projections of the Consensus Forecast (CFC), the growth of the world economy stands out at around 2.6% in 2015, improving to 2.8% in 2016. World growth would be led by the expansion of the industrialized countries , while the deceleration in emerging economies continues. In that sense, the US would register an expansion of 2.5% in both 2015 and 2016, while the Euro Zone (ZE) would continue consolidating its recovery with growth rates of 1.5% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2016. It is expected that Inflation tends to approach 2.0% in both the US and the ZE, while unemployment continues to fall.","12","15",4
"On the other hand, the macroeconomic conditions of the emerging economies remain weak, while the outlook points to a slight improvement in 2016. In this line, Consensus Forecast estimates that Latin America would contract by 1.0% in 2015 and fall 0.1% in 2016. This result would be influenced by the evolution of Venezuela and Brazil, which would remain in recession until 2016, as well as by the moderation of growth in the net exporting economies of raw materials in the region. At the same time, in international markets, the fall in oil prices has worsened, which have already fallen to minimum levels since 2009, while the appreciation of the dollar continues.","12","15",5
"Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential. The most recent information from the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) trend-cycle suggests that the economy is above the productive capacity of the economy, indicating that the current forecasts of the International Monetary Fund that contemplate a real GDP growth would be fulfilled in the range of 6.5% -7.0% for the close of this year. In the financial sector, private loans in national currency show double-digit growth, exceeding nominal product growth.","12","15",6
"The external accounts of the economy continue to improve in an environment of low oil prices and good performance in revenues from tourism, remittances and exports from free zones. It is expected that by the end of 2015, the current account deficit will be around 2.0% of GDP, a situation that would remain for next year. With regard to fiscal policy, a primary surplus would be obtained in the current year that should be maintained next year, according to the 2016 Budget. These positive results in the external and fiscal accounts would facilitate the accumulation of reserves and the relative stability of the exchange market.","12","15",7
"The Central Bank confirms its commitment to implement monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to take the necessary measures against possible risks to stability of prices and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","12","15",8
"At its monetary policy meeting for the month of December 2016, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate (MPR) at 5.50% per annum.","12","16",1
"The decision on the reference rate was preceded by an exhaustive analysis of the national economic panorama, of the international environment relevant to the Dominican economy, and of market expectations regarding the main macroeconomic variables. Additionally, the balance of risks around the inflation projections was evaluated in order to prevent any deviation in the BCRD target. The latest data on inflation indicates that the interannual rate stood at 0.88% as of November, while the accumulated inflation rate reached 0.79% in the first eleven months of the year. Core interannual inflation, which reflects the monetary conditions of the economy, stood at 1.79 percent. By the end of the year, inflation would end well below the lower limit of the goal of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0%, contemplated in the Monetary Program.","12","16",2
"In the external context, according to Consensus Forecast, the world economy would grow 2.5% in 2016, expecting an expansion of 2.8% for 2017 thanks to improvements in the growth projections of the United States of America (USA) and some emerging economies. In the case of the US, this year's growth would close around 1.6%, accelerating next year to 2.3%. On the other hand, real production in the Euro Zone (ZE) would grow 1.6% in 2016 and 1.4% in 2017. Inflation in these industrialized economies would remain positive, gradually approaching their respective targets. In that sense, inflation rates of 1.3% are expected for the US and 0.2% for the ZE in 2016. For next year 2017, inflation would rise to 2.4% in the US and 1.3% in the ZE. It should be noted that in the industrialized economies, labor market improvements would continue, with the US remaining in full employment and reaching a one-digit unemployment rate for the first time since the beginning of the 2007 financial crisis.","12","16",3
"The perspectives of the emerging economies for 2017 indicate improvements in some of the larger economies such as Brazil and Russia. Both economies would be coming out of the recessions that affected them in 2016. China, on the other hand, would grow 6.6% in 2016 and 6.2% in 2017 according to the IMF, while India would have growth rates above 7.0% during these years. According to Consensus Forecast, Latin America would register a fall (-0.5%) in 2016, mainly due to significant contractions in economies such as Argentina (-2.3%), Brazil (-3.4%), Ecuador (-2.0%) and Venezuela (-10.7). %). There was also a slowdown in the growth of some commodity exporters such as Chile (1.6%), Colombia (2.0%) and Mexico (2.0%). For 2017, a recovery of growth in the region that would grow 1.8% is projected, driven by a better performance in Argentina (2.9%), Brazil (0.8%), Chile (2.1%), Colombia (2.5%) and Peru (4.2 %).","12","16",4
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity evolves favorably in the short term. According to preliminary figures, the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) would have grown around 6.4% in the January-November period, which would be the highest growth in Latin America for the third consecutive year. Credit to the private sector in national currency has expanded to around 12.0% to date, a rate consistent with the evolution of the Nominal Gross Domestic Product so far this year. With regard to fiscal policy, the rate of growth of public spending has slowed markedly in the second half of the year, indicating a more moderate fiscal policy, despite the reconstruction efforts in the areas of the country affected by the recent floods. ","12","16",5
"This fiscal effort, together with a current account deficit that would close the year between 1.7% and 1.9% of GDP, indicates that the Dominican economy remains healthy, exhibiting solid macroeconomic fundamentals, which creates favorable conditions for accumulating international reserves and promoting relative stability of the exchange market.","12","16",6
"The Central Bank reaffirms its commitment to continue conducting monetary policy aimed at achieving its inflation target and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while continuing to monitor the evolution of the world economy and the domestic situation, in order to adopt the necessary measures in the face of risks regarding price stability and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems.","12","16",7
"At its monetary policy meeting of December 2017, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to maintain its monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% per annum.","12","17",1
"The decision on the reference rate was adopted after an exhaustive analysis of the balance of risks around the inflation forecasts, the evolution of the main national macroeconomic indicators, the international environment relevant to the Dominican economy, market expectations and the medium-term projections of this set of variables. Monthly inflation for November was 0.76%, causing accumulated inflation that month to reach 3.20%. Year-on-year inflation reached 4.14%, around the central value of the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% established in the Monetary Program. Additionally, core inflation, related to monetary conditions, stands at 2.31% year-on-year. Forecasts indicate that inflation would remain within the target range in the monetary policy horizon of 24 months.","12","17",2
"In the external context, the world economy would close 2017 with a growth of 3.1% while the outlook for 2018 remains positive projecting an expansion rate of 3.2%, according to Consensus Forecast. The dynamism of the world economy in 2018 would be explained, to a large extent, by the behavior of the advanced economies. In this regard, growth forecasts for this group of countries have been revised upwards, projecting for the United States of America (USA), product expansions of 2.3% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018, while for the Euro Zone ( ZE) growth would be 2.3% and 2.1%, during those years. Inflationary pressures in these economies would remain moderate, projecting 2.1% for the US in 2017 and 2018, while inflation in the EZ would be 1.5% and 1.4%, during the same period.","12","17",3
"In Latin America the recovery is consolidated during 2017. With the exception of Venezuela, all the countries of the region would present positive growth. In that sense, the growth prospects, according to Consensus Forecast, point to an expansion of the Latin American economy of 1.8% by the end of 2017 and 2.6% in 2018.","12","17",4
"International prices of primary goods have maintained an upward trend in recent months, while international financial conditions remain relatively favorable for emerging economies in the short term due to the abundant liquidity worldwide.","12","17",5
"In the domestic sphere, economic activity has reacted very positively to the expansionary monetary measures implemented since August. Since then, credit to the private sector in national currency has increased around RD $ 55 billion, for year-on-year growth of more than 11.5%, which has contributed to the recovery of domestic demand. In effect, preliminary information from the Monthly Indicator of Economic Activity (IMAE) indicates an expansion of 6.8% during the month of November, reaching an accumulated growth of 4.2% during January-November of this year. Monetary conditions are expected to remain favorable, contributing to economic growth being around 4.5% at the end of 2017 and improving to 5.0% -5.5% by 2018.","12","17",6
"Regarding public finances, the Central Government maintains the projection of a deficit of 2.3% of GDP established in the National Budget, in the context of a more active fiscal policy during the second half of the year. On the other hand, the external sector continues to show a positive performance, contributing to the increase in foreign exchange earnings and the strengthening of international reserves, in an environment of relative stability of the exchange rate.","12","17",7
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability, helping to create the conditions for the economy to grow around its potential.

"At its monetary policy meeting of December 2018, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) decided to keep its monetary policy interest rate at 5.50% per annum.","12","18",1
"The decision to leave the reference rate unchanged is based on a detailed analysis of the balance of risks around inflation forecasts, including information from international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. The monthly inflation for November was -0.35%, so the accumulated inflation during the first eleven months of the year was 1.39% and it is estimated with preliminary information in December that inflation would close the year at 1.3%. The forecast system indicates that inflation would gradually converge to the target range of 4.0% <U+00B1> 1.0% during the next year.","12","18",2
"In the international environment, forecasts remain that the world economy would grow 3.2% during 2018 and moderate to 3.0% in 2019, according to Consensus Forecast. The global expansion of economic activity would continue to be driven by the United States of America (USA), which would grow 2.9% in 2018 and 2.6% in 2019. Given the continuing dynamism of the US economy and the conditions of full employment in the labor market , the Federal Reserve (FED) increased its benchmark interest rate by 25 basic points at its December meeting to a range of 2.25% - 2.50%. However, the FED said that by 2019 it expects a process of normalization of the monetary policy more gradual than initially expected, associated with lower inflationary prospects for next year.","12","18",3
"On the other hand, Consensus continues to downgrade the growth prospects of the Euro Zone (ZE) for both 2018 and 2019, estimating expansions of 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. This moderation in the ZE is influenced by the slowdown in some of its main economies, such as Germany, Italy and France. Given that the inflation forecasts for this group of countries remain below their target, the monetary policy stance of the European Central Bank would remain expansive in the medium term, which would contribute to increasing the interest rate differential with the US and to the strengthening of the US dollar in international markets.","12","18",4
"In the case of Latin America, the region is projected to grow moderately by 1.4% during 2018 and 1.9% in 2019, driven by the dynamism of economies such as the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Panama, Paraguay, Chile and Peru. However, the growth projections of countries with economic vulnerabilities and socio-political tensions such as Venezuela, Argentina and Nicaragua continue to be corrected downwards.","12","18",5
"As for raw materials, there has been a significant reduction in the price of oil in recent months, leading to West Texas Intermediation (WTI) crude at levels close to US $ 45 per barrel. . This fall in the price of oil is associated with both supply and demand factors, especially the increase in oil production in economies that are not part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the prospects for a moderation in global growth. However, according to the International Energy Agency, the reduction in the price of oil would be transitory, averaging in 2019 around US $ 55 per barrel.","12","18",6
"Domestically, economic activity continues to grow above its potential, in a context of absence of inflationary pressures. In effect, according to preliminary estimates, the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would expand by 7.0% during 2018, driven mainly by investment and private consumption. Consistent with the economic dynamism, there is an expansion of credit to the private sector in national currency close to 11.0% year-on-year and a year-on-year growth of 11.2% in bills and coins issued, known as high-power money.","12","18",7
"It is important to note that the weighted average passive interest rate of the multiple banks has increased by around 200 basis points after the increase of the Monetary Policy Rate of July 2018. This adjustment has allowed to close the interest rate differential with respect to to the US rates, helping to avoid any significant change in the investment portfolio in domestic and foreign currency that could put macroeconomic stability at risk.","12","18",8
"On the fiscal policy side, the moderation of public sector expenditures with year-on-year growth of 5.2% was maintained as of November, while the expansion of revenues reached 13.2% year-on-year, contributing to the consolidation process of Public finances In the external sector, foreign exchange generating activities, such as tourism, remittances and exports, maintain a remarkable dynamism, with the current account deficit expected to be around 1.4% of GDP at the end of the year, associated with the higher oil prices. The good performance of the external sector has facilitated the accumulation of international reserves that exceed US $ 7,100 million, equivalent to a reserve coverage over the 4 months of imports and contributing to the relative stability of the exchange rate.","12","18",9
"The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic is attentive to the evolution of the normalization of the monetary policy of the United States, as well as the dynamics of the dollar and the price of oil in the international market, being prepared to react in a timely manner to any factor that can generate inflationary deviations. In this sense, the issuing entity reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy to achieve its inflation target and the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems, thus contributing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.","12","18",10

"The benchmark decision is based on detailed risk balance analysis for inflation forecasts, including international and domestic macroeconomic indicators, market expectations and medium-term projections. November's monthly inflation was 0.37%, while cumulative inflation stood at 3.45%. On the other hand, year-on-year inflation, i.e. from November 2018 to November 2019, stood at 3.23%, returning to the target range of 4.0% to 1.0%. Underlying inflation, reflecting monetary conditions, stood at 2.20% in November. For their part, both the inflation expectations of economic analysts and the BCRD forecasting system indicate that inflation would close 2019 below the target's core value and remain around 4.0% by 2020.","12","19",3
"In the international environment, economic uncertainty has moderated slightly in recent months as the first phase of a trade agreement between the United States of America (USA) and China has been achieved, while there is greater clarity about the UK's exit from the European Union (Brexit). In that context, Consensus Forecasts, which brings together leading analyst firms that make international projections, maintains the forecast of moderate growth for the global economy of 2.5% for both 2019 and 2020, while the International Monetary Fund foresees an overall expansion of 3.0% for 2019 and 3.4% by 2020, according to the latest publication of the Economic Outlook in October.","12","19",4
"Economic activity in the U.S. has gradually slowed, projecting growth to move from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019 and 1.8% by 2020, according to Consensus. In the face of weakening the economy and low inflation, the Fed has reduced its benchmark rate three times, accumulating a 75 basis point decline in the year. In addition, the Fed has been providing greater liquidity to the financial system through repurchase agreements (REPOS) and purchases of Treasury bills on the secondary market, with the goal of reducing short-term interest rates. Moving forward, the Fed and market analysts do not anticipate additional adjustments to the federal funding rate during 2020.","12","19",5
"As for the Euro Area, the growth outlook remains low, rising at 1.2% and 1.0% for 2019 and 2020, respectively, conditioned by the weak performance of the industrial sector and the slowdown in international trade. Considering the absence of inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank continues to implement a package of expansive measures including the liquidity provision programme for the private sector credit channeling and the purchase of sovereign debt securities on the secondary market.","12","19",6
"On the other hand, in Latin America, the deterioration of economic activity has been accentuated as a result of socio-political conflicts that have arisen in several of the countries of the region. Thus, growth prospects for Latin America remain low, with an expansion of 0.4% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. The region's economic slowdown is influenced by negative growth rates this year in Venezuela, Nicaragua, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Mexico, as well as the modest expansion of Brazil and the negative impact of social demonstrations in countries such as Chile, Bolivia and Colombia.","12","19",7
